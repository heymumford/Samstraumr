# ALZ001 Machine-Level Mock Implementations

This directory contains mock implementations for machine-level (L2) test classes. Each machine implements complex behaviors using composites and components.

## Planned Contents

- `ProteinExpressionMachine.java`: Mock machine for complex protein expression analysis
- `NeuronalNetworkMachine.java`: Mock machine for neuronal network simulation
- `TimeSeriesAnalysisMachine.java`: Mock machine for advanced time series modeling
- `EnvironmentalFactorsMachine.java`: Mock machine for environmental impact simulation
- `PredictiveModelingMachine.java`: Mock machine for ensemble prediction
- `TreatmentOptimizationMachine.java`: Mock machine for treatment optimization

## Usage

All machines should extend `ALZ001MockComponent` and contain references to their composite parts. They should be created using the appropriate factory method in `ALZ001MockFactory`.
