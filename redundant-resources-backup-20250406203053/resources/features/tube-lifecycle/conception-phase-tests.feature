Feature: Tube Substrate Identity - Conception Phase
  As a system architect
  I want tubes to establish proper substrate identity at conception
  So that they maintain a consistent biological continuity model

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured

@Functional @SubstrateIdentity @UniqueIdentification @Positive @Conception @L0_Tube @Identity
  Scenario: Tube is created with a unique identifier
    When a new tube is created
    Then the tube should have a unique identifier
    And the tube should have a creation timestamp
    And the tube should capture the environmental context
    
@Functional @SubstrateIdentity @CreationTracking @Positive @Conception @L0_Tube @Identity @Monitoring
  Scenario: Tube captures initialization parameters in its identity
    When the tube initializes with custom parameters
    Then the tube should incorporate the parameters into its identity
    And the tube should have a unique identifier
    And the tube should have a creation timestamp
    
@ErrorHandling @SubstrateIdentity @UniqueIdentification @Negative @Conception @L0_Tube @Identity @Resilience
  Scenario: Tube handles invalid initialization gracefully
    When the tube is created with invalid parameters
    Then the tube creation should fail gracefully
    And an appropriate error message should be logged
