@L3_System @Functional @DataFlow
Feature: Data Processing System Acceptance
  As a business user
  I want a robust data processing system
  So that I can reliably process business data

  Background:
    Given the Samstraumr system is initialized
    And the system is configured for business use

  @Functional @Identity
  Scenario: New data processing system should have a unique identity
    When I query the system identity
    Then the system should have a valid UUID
    And the system should have a human-readable name
    And the system should report its version information

  @Functional @DataFlow @Transformer
  Scenario: System should process customer data correctly
    Given the following customer data:
      | customer_id | name          | email                  | subscription |
      | C1001       | John Smith    | john.smith@example.com | Premium      |
      | C1002       | Jane Doe      | jane.doe@example.com   | Basic        |
      | C1003       | Bob Johnson   | bob.j@example.com      | Premium      |
    When I process the customer data through the system
    Then the system should successfully process all records
    And premium customer data should be flagged for priority handling
    And customer email addresses should be properly anonymized

  @Functional @Filter
  Scenario: System should reject invalid business data
    Given the following invalid customer data:
      | customer_id | name          | email                | subscription |
      | C2001       | Alex White    | not-an-email         | Premium      |
      | C2002       |               | jane.doe@example.com | Basic        |
      | C2003       | Maria Garcia  | maria@example.com    | InvalidTier  |
    When I process the customer data through the system
    Then the system should reject all invalid records
    And detailed validation errors should be provided for each record
    And the system should maintain a clean state

  @Functional @Performance
  Scenario: System should meet business performance requirements
    Given a batch of 1000 standard business records
    When I process the batch with timing
    Then the processing should complete within 5 seconds
    And resource usage should remain below critical thresholds
    And all records should be properly processed

  @Functional @Resilience
  Scenario: System should recover from external service failures
    Given the external data service is unavailable
    When I attempt to process business data requiring the external service
    Then the system should gracefully handle the service failure
    And the system should retry the operation according to business policy
    And after external service recovery, processing should succeed

  @Functional @State @Monitoring
  Scenario: System should maintain auditable processing history
    Given the system contains previously processed business data
    When I request an audit report for processing activities
    Then the report should include all processing operations
    And the report should include timestamps for all operations
    And the report should identify the source and destination of all data
    And the report should comply with business retention policies
