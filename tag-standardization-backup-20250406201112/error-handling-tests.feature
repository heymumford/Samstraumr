Filename: error-handling-tests.feature
Purpose: Validates the error handling capabilities of Components
Goals:
  - Verify proper error handling for invalid parameters
  - Test exception handling during state transitions
  - Validate resource cleanup after error conditions
Dependencies:
  - BDD step definitions in org.s8r.component.test.steps package
  - Component exception handlers in org.s8r.component.exception

@ATL @L0_Core @ErrorHandling
Feature: Component Error Handling and Negative Paths
  Components should handle errors gracefully, providing clear messages
  and ensuring proper resource cleanup in error conditions.

  @ATL @L0_Core @ErrorHandling @InvalidParams
  Scenario Outline: Component initialization with invalid parameters
    Given a basic environment for component initialization
    When component initialization is attempted with invalid <parameter>
    Then initialization should fail with appropriate <error_type>
    And the error message should mention <parameter>
    And no component resources should be leaked

    Examples:
      | parameter    | error_type               |
      | null reason  | IllegalArgumentException |
      | empty reason | IllegalArgumentException |
      | null environment | IllegalArgumentException |

  @ATL @L0_Core @ErrorHandling @InvalidOperations
  Scenario: Operations on terminated component
    Given a basic environment for component initialization
    When a component is initialized with reason "Terminated Operation Test"
    And the component is terminated
    Then operations on the terminated component should be rejected:
      | Operation        | Error Type                 |
      | setState         | InvalidStateTransitionException |
      | createChild      | ComponentException        |
      | updateEnvironment | ComponentException        |
    And appropriate error messages should be provided
    And the component should remain in terminated state

  @ATL @L0_Core @ErrorHandling @ResourceCleanup
  Scenario: Resource cleanup after error conditions
    Given a basic environment for component initialization
    When a component is initialized with reason "Resource Cleanup Test"
    And a component operation fails with an exception
    Then the component should clean up resources properly
    And memory usage should not increase after the error
    And any open resources should be closed
    And the error condition should be logged

  @ATL @L0_Core @ErrorHandling @Concurrent
  Scenario: Concurrent error handling
    Given a basic environment for component initialization
    When 5 components are initialized simultaneously with invalid conditions
    Then all error conditions should be handled independently
    And no exceptions should escape the error handling framework
    And each component should log its own error condition
    And the system should remain stable

  @ATL @L0_Core @ErrorHandling @Recovery
  Scenario: Component error recovery
    Given a basic environment for component initialization
    When a component is initialized with reason "Error Recovery Test"
    And the component encounters a recoverable error
    Then the component should enter error recovery mode
    And the component should attempt to self-heal
    And the component should log recovery attempts
    And the component should either recover or terminate gracefully
