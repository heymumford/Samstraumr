## Critical Gates (Your Role)

You're responsible for ensuring these decisions happen on time:

| Gate | Week | Question | Your Input |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Gate 1** | 4 (Mar 6) | Consciousness falsifiable? | Cognitive load findings so far? |
| **Gate 2** | 8 (Apr 3) | Metaphor improves learning? | Study results + statistical confidence? |
| **Gate 3** | 12 (May 1) | Architecture sound? | Chaos engineering findings ready? |
| **Gate 4** | 15 (May 22) | **Recovery ≥70%?** | **Your recovery experiment results** ⚠️ |
| **Gate 5** | 20 (Jun 26) | All validated? | Final data + paper sections? |

**Gate 4 is existential**: If recovery <70%, entire paper narrative changes. Your experiment data determines success.

---

## Contingency & Risk Mitigation

### If Developer Recruitment Stalls
**Trigger**: <30 developers recruited by Week 2
**Action**:
- Shift to internal Guild recruitment only (guaranteed cohort)
- Reduce study participant target to 30
- Timeline stays same, sample size reduced

### If Study Results Show No Difference
**Trigger**: Cognitive load shows p > 0.05 (no statistical significance)
**Action**:
- Investigate: Was effect size too small for sample?
- Pivot to alternative metric (task completion time?)
- Document negative result (still publishable)

### If Recovery Experiments Show <70% Success
**Trigger**: Week 15 Gate 4: Recovery rate only 45%
**Action**:
- Root cause analysis (what failed?)
- Pivot paper narrative: "Enabling Architecture" (Rank 42a)
- Still publishable, different framing
- Feed learnings into future architecture work

---

## Your Voice in the Research

This isn't a "follow-the-plan" role. You'll have significant autonomy:

- **Design Control**: You own experimental methodology (within gate criteria)
- **Decision Authority**: You recommend GO/NO-GO on Gate 2 & 4 decisions
- **Paper Co-Authorship**: Expect publication credit on papers 38, 42, 43 (if you contribute analysis)
- **Publication Bonus** (optional): $1,000 per published paper (at your discretion to accept or decline)

---

## Why This Role Matters

The Samstraumr project is exploring a bold hypothesis: **Can software systems be conscious of their own recovery?** Your experiments will either validate this or reveal why it doesn't work. Either way, the world of systems architecture will be better for the rigorous science.

You're not building features. You're answering deep questions about resilience, learning, and what it means for a system to know itself.

1. Send resume + CV
