/**
 * Test runner for Port Interface tests.
 * 
 * <p>This test runner executes the Cucumber feature tests that verify
 * the port interfaces in the Samstraumr project. It uses the @port tag
 * to filter for the relevant feature files in the port-interfaces directory.
 * 
 * <p>The following port interfaces are tested:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Cache Port - For data caching operations</li>
 *   <li>Configuration Port - For configuration management</li>
 *   <li>DataFlow Event Port - For component data flow communication</li>
 *   <li>Event Publisher Port - For publishing and subscribing to events</li>
 *   <li>Filesystem Port - For file system operations</li>
 *   <li>Messaging Port - For messaging operations</li>
 *   <li>Notification Port - For sending notifications</li>
 *   <li>Persistence Port - For data persistence operations</li>
 *   <li>Security Port - For security and authorization operations</li>
 *   <li>Task Execution Port - For asynchronous task execution</li>
 *   <li>Validation Port - For data validation operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>These tests ensure that port interfaces adhere to clean architecture
 * principles and properly separate domains from implementation details.
