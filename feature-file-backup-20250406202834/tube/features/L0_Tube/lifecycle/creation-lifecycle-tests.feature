Feature: Tube Creation Lifecycle Tests
  As a system architect
  I want to verify the complete creation lifecycle of tubes
  So that the full biological metaphor is implemented from the earliest stages

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured
  
  # Phase 1: Non-existence to Potential
@Functional  @PreExistence @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Positive
  Scenario: Intention precedes existence in tube creation
    When a creation intention is formed
    Then a creation plan should exist
    And the plan should contain a purpose definition
    And the plan should specify resource requirements
    And the plan should define a projected lifespan
    But no tube instance should exist yet
    
  # Phase 2: Pre-conception Resource Preparation
@Functional  @PreConception @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @ResourcePreparation @Positive
  Scenario: Resources are prepared before tube conception
    Given a creation intention exists
    When resource allocation is initiated
    Then memory resources should be reserved
    And identity generation capability should be verified
    And environmental context should be prepared
    And the environment should be receptive to new tube creation
    
  # Phase 3: Conception Moment
@Functional  @Conception @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @ExistenceTransition @Positive
  Scenario: Tube transitions from non-existence to existence during conception
    Given all necessary resources have been allocated
    When the tube creation is executed
    Then a new tube instance should exist
    And the tube should have a precise timestamp marking its conception
    And the tube should have a lifecycle state of CONCEPTION
    And the tube's identity should be established
    And the creation timestamp should be recorded in the tube's lineage
    
  # Phase 4: Initial Identity Formation
@Functional  @EarlyConception @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @SubstrateFormation @Positive
  Scenario: Tube establishes substrate identity at conception
    Given a tube has been conceived
    When the identity establishment process completes
    Then the tube should have a unique identifier
    And the tube should have an immutable creation reason
    And the tube should incorporate environmental context in its identity
    And the tube should establish awareness of its creator if applicable
    
  # Phase 5: Zygotic State
@Functional  @ZygoticPhase @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @InitialState @Positive
  Scenario: Newly conceived tube enters zygotic state
    Given a tube with established identity
    When the tube enters the zygotic state
    Then the tube should have minimal but complete structure
    And the tube should be capable of maintaining its internal state
    And the tube should have its core survival mechanisms initialized
    And the tube should not yet have specialized functions
    
  # Phase 6: Preparing for Early Development
@Functional  @PreCleavage @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @DevelopmentPreparation @Positive
  Scenario: Zygotic tube prepares for cellular division analog
    Given a tube in zygotic state
    When development initialization begins
    Then the tube should define its initial growth pattern
    And the tube should establish boundaries for internal structures
    And the tube should prepare for structural organization
    And the tube should transition to INITIALIZING state
    
  # Lineage Tests for Creation
@Functional  @CreationLineage @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Hierarchy @Positive
  Scenario: Adam tube and child tube relationship establishes proper lineage
    Given an origin tube exists in the system
    When the origin tube initiates creation of a child tube
    Then the child tube should reference its parent in its lineage
    And the parent tube should be aware of its child
    And the child tube should inherit selected characteristics from its parent
    And the creation hierarchy should be properly established
    
@Functional  @CreationLineage @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Hierarchy @Positive
  Scenario: Creation events are recorded in the lineage history
    Given multiple tubes with parent-child relationships exist
    When the tubes' lineage records are examined
    Then each tube should have a complete record of its ancestry
    And creation events should be recorded with timestamps
    And each tube should be able to trace its lineage back to an Adam tube
    And the hierarchical structure should be internally consistent
    
  # Negative Tests for Creation Lifecycle
@Functional  @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Negative
  Scenario: Resource constraint prevents tube creation
    Given the system has limited resources
    When a tube creation with excessive resource requirements is attempted
    Then the creation should fail gracefully
    And all pre-allocated resources should be released
    And an appropriate error should be reported
    And the system should remain in a consistent state
    
@Functional  @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Negative
  Scenario: Invalid identity parameters prevent tube creation
    Given the system environment is properly configured
    When tube creation with invalid identity parameters is attempted
    Then the creation should be rejected
    And an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown
    And the error should clearly indicate the invalid parameters
    And no partial tube should remain in the system
    
@Functional  @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Negative
  Scenario: Creation fails with circular parent reference
    Given an existing tube in the system
    When creating a new tube that attempts to reference itself as parent
    Then the creation should fail with an appropriate error
    And the system should detect the circular reference
    And the error should indicate that circular lineage is prohibited
    And the system hierarchy should remain valid
    
@Functional  @CreationLifecycle @L0_Tube @Identity @Negative
  Scenario: Environmental incompatibility prevents tube creation
    Given an environment with incompatible parameters
    When tube creation is attempted in this environment
    Then the creation should fail with an environmental compatibility error
    And the system should indicate which parameters are incompatible
    And suggest environment modifications to support tube creation
