@L3_System
Feature: System External Integration
  As a system integrator
  I want to verify that the system integrates correctly with external systems
  So that I can ensure seamless operation within a broader ecosystem

  Background:
    Given a system environment with external integration capabilities
    And mock services for external dependencies are available

@Integration @ExternalAPI
  Scenario: System should communicate with external REST APIs
    Given a system configured to integrate with an external REST API
    When the system sends requests to the external API
    Then the requests should be properly formatted
    And the system should correctly interpret API responses
    And the system should handle different response codes appropriately
    And API communication should be properly secured
    And performance metrics for external API calls should be recorded

@Integration @MessageQueue
  Scenario: System should integrate with message queuing systems
    Given a system connected to an external message queue
    When messages are published to the queue for processing
    Then the system should consume the messages reliably
    And message processing should be tracked for completion
    And failed processing should be handled with appropriate retry logic
    And the system should manage message acknowledgments correctly
    And message ordering guarantees should be maintained

@Integration @Database
  Scenario: System should interact correctly with external databases
    Given a system with external database dependencies
    When the system performs database operations
    Then connections should be managed efficiently
    And transactions should be properly isolated
    And the system should handle database failures gracefully
    And query performance should be monitored
    And database schema changes should be handled appropriately

@Integration @FileSystem
  Scenario: System should handle external file system operations
    Given a system that reads and writes to external file storage
    When file operations are performed under various conditions
    Then files should be read and written correctly
    And the system should handle file system latency
    And file locking should be managed properly
    And the system should recover from file system errors
    And large file operations should be performed efficiently

@Integration @Authentication
  Scenario: System should integrate with external authentication services
    Given a system that uses an external authentication provider
    When users authenticate through the external provider
    Then authentication results should be correctly interpreted
    And user sessions should be properly established
    And the system should handle authentication service outages
    And single sign-on flows should work correctly
    And authentication token management should be secure

  @Integration @ThirdPartyServices
  Scenario Outline: System should integrate with various third-party services
    Given a system configured to use <service_type> service
    When the system interacts with the <service_type> service
    Then the integration should function according to specifications
    And the system should handle service-specific error conditions
    And performance metrics should be collected for the integration

    Examples:
      | service_type   |
      | email          |
      | notification   |
      | analytics      |
      | payment        |
      | geolocation    |

@Integration @DataSynchronization
  Scenario: System should synchronize data with external systems
    Given a system that maintains synchronized data with an external system
    When data changes occur in either system
    Then changes should be propagated to maintain consistency
    And conflict resolution should be applied when necessary
    And synchronization should handle intermittent connectivity
    And large data volume synchronization should be efficient
    And synchronization status should be monitored

@Integration @Legacy
  Scenario: System should integrate with legacy systems
    Given a system that must interact with a legacy system
    When data is exchanged with the legacy system
    Then data format transformations should be applied correctly
    And the integration should accommodate legacy system constraints
    And the system should handle legacy system performance characteristics
    And proper error handling should manage legacy system limitations
