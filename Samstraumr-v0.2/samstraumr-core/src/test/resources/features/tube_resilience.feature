Feature: Autonomous Adaptation and Resilience

  Scenario: Tube Self-Preservation under Stress
    Given a Tube operating under normal conditions
    When the Tube detects dangerous conditions
    Then it should pause or terminate operations
    And notify connected tubes of its status change

  Scenario: Tube Transforms into a New Entity
    Given a Tube that has detected misalignment with its purpose
    When the Tube decides to transform into a new entity with reason "New Purpose"
    Then it should create a new Tube with the updated reason
    And gracefully terminate its own operations
    And the new Tube should retain the lineage of the original Tube

  Scenario: Tube Dynamic Scaling and Replication
    Given a Tube experiencing increased workload
    When the Tube detects that scaling is required
    Then it should replicate itself to handle the workload
    And the replicas should share the workload appropriately
