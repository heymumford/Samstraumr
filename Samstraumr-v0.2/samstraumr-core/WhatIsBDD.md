# What is Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

Synthesized by Eric Mumford from experience and several sources.

Behavior-Driven Development streamlines the software development process by focusing on the desired behavior of the application. By involving all stakeholders in defining clear, testable requirements, BDD ensures that the final product meets business needs and provides real value to users. Whether you're a layperson or a software engineer, BDD offers a structured yet flexible approach to building effective software solutions.

**Introduction to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative approach to software development that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members. It enhances communication by using a simple, shared language to describe the behavior of an application, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of project requirements.

**Underlying Principles of BDD**

1. **Focus on Expected Behavior**: Instead of concentrating on testing individual components (as in Test-Driven Development), BDD emphasizes specifying the expected behavior of the system from the user's perspective.

2. **Use of Ubiquitous Language**: BDD encourages using a common language derived from the business domain. This shared vocabulary helps prevent misunderstandings and aligns the development team with business goals.

3. **Collaboration Among Stakeholders**: Developers, testers, and business analysts work together to define requirements. This collaboration ensures that everyone has the same understanding of what needs to be built.

4. **Executable Specifications**: Requirements are written in a clear format that can be turned into automated tests. These tests serve as both documentation and validation of the system's behavior.

**Practical Operations of BDD**

1. **Writing User Stories**:

   - **Template**:
     - **As a** [user role]
     - **I want** [feature]
     - **So that** [benefit]

   - **Purpose**: Captures who needs what and why, focusing on delivering business value.

2. **Defining Acceptance Criteria with Scenarios**:

   - **Format**:
     - **Given** [initial context]
     - **When** [event occurs]
     - **Then** [outcome]

   - **Purpose**: Breaks down user stories into specific, testable examples of desired behavior.

3. **Automating Scenarios**:

   - **Tools**: Use BDD frameworks like Cucumber, JBehave, or SpecFlow to turn written scenarios into executable tests.

   - **Purpose**: Ensures that specifications are always up-to-date and that the system behaves as expected.

4. **Developing to Meet Specifications**:

   - **Process**:
     - Write code to fulfill the scenarios.
     - Run automated tests to verify behavior.
     - Refactor code while keeping tests green.

   - **Purpose**: Aligns development with defined behaviors, reducing defects and rework.

5. **Continuous Feedback and Refinement**:

   - **Feedback Loop**: Failing tests highlight deviations from expected behavior, allowing for immediate correction.

   - **Collaboration**: Regular discussions among team members to refine requirements based on new insights or changes.

**Example of BDD in Action**


**User Story: Customer Withdraws Cash**

- **As a** customer
- **I want** to withdraw cash from an ATM
- **So that** I don't have to wait in line at the bank

**Scenario 1: Successful Withdrawal**

- **Given** the account is in credit
- **And** the card is valid
- **And** the ATM contains sufficient cash
- **When** the customer requests cash
- **Then** the ATM should dispense the cash
- **And** the account balance is debited
- **And** the card is returned

**Scenario 2: Insufficient Funds**

- **Given** the account is overdrawn beyond the overdraft limit
- **And** the card is valid
- **When** the customer requests cash
- **Then** the ATM should display an insufficient funds message
- **And** cash should not be dispensed
- **And** the card is returned

**Benefits of BDD**

- **Enhanced Communication**: A shared language improves collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

- **Clear Requirements**: Well-defined behaviors reduce ambiguity and misunderstandings.

- **Quality Assurance**: Automated tests catch issues early, leading to more reliable software.

- **Adaptability**: The iterative nature of BDD accommodates changes in requirements smoothly.

Driving Principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This approach ensures that the codebase remains robust, maintainable, and adaptable to change. The driving principles of TDD, as highlighted by Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) in his talk, focus on several key concepts:

Write Tests Before Code:

Foundation of TDD: Writing tests first is the cornerstone of TDD. It ensures that each piece of code is written to fulfill a specific requirement, as defined by a failing test.
Purposeful Development: By starting with a test, developers clarify what the code is supposed to achieve before implementation, leading to more intentional and focused coding.
Enable Confident Refactoring:

Safety Net of Tests: A comprehensive suite of tests allows developers to modify and improve code without fear of introducing bugs. Tests verify that changes haven't broken existing functionality.
Continuous Improvement: TDD promotes regular refactoring, keeping the codebase clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.
Prevent Fear of Changing Code:

Overcoming Hesitation: Without tests, developers may become reluctant to alter code due to the risk of unknown side effects, leading to code rot and technical debt.
Empowerment: Tests empower developers to take control of their code, ensuring they are not intimidated by complexity or potential errors.
Ensure Comprehensive Test Coverage:

Every Line is Tested: Writing tests first means that all production code is written to make a failing test pass, ensuring thorough test coverage.
Trust in the Test Suite: Developers can rely on their tests to catch issues, fostering confidence in the stability of the codebase.
Facilitate Better Design Decisions:

Design for Testability: TDD encourages writing code that is modular and testable, often resulting in better overall design and architecture.
Simplicity and Clarity: By focusing on passing tests, developers tend to write only the necessary code, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
Act as Living Documentation:

Clear Specifications: Tests serve as documentation that explains what the code does, providing clarity for current and future team members.
Alignment with Requirements: They ensure that the implementation aligns with the specified requirements and behaves as expected.
Promote Discipline and Focus:

Structured Workflow: TDD follows a simple cycle: write a failing test, write code to pass the test, refactor the code. This discipline keeps development efforts aligned and efficient.
Preventing Overengineering: Developers concentrate on fulfilling current requirements without adding speculative features.
Conclusion

The driving principles of Test-Driven Development revolve around writing tests before code to guide development, enable safe refactoring, and maintain control over the codebase. TDD mitigates the fear associated with changing code by providing a robust safety net, which in turn prevents code rot and promotes a cleaner, more maintainable system. By ensuring that every piece of code is justified by a test and by facilitating better design choices, TDD helps developers produce high-quality software that meets requirements and adapts easily to new demands.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create code that is not only functional but also resilient, easy to understand, and ready for future enhancements. This approach ultimately leads to more efficient development cycles, better collaboration among team members, and software that delivers real value to users.
