# Samstraumr

The word "Samstraumr" is intended to be interpreted as a fusion of the Old Norse words "sam" (together) and "straumr" (stream or flow).

Samstraumr embodies the ideals of guided flow, a methodology where data, technology, and human systems alike are modeled as tubes.
Tubes are essential constructs that provide structure and direction. 
Inspired by Nordic mythology and The Poetic Edda, Samstraumr seeks to create a framework where principles are reflected as a base class of tubes, 
with each tube signifying a distinct pathway for a particular type of input data, work, processes, outcomes, and deterministic decisions.

In this vision, every flow must have boundaries to transform into meaningful outcomes. 
By embracing the tube-based development metaphor, we can construct systems that recognize the inherent start, middle, and end of any operation or computation. 
This framework promotes efficiency and scale of computational processes but more importantly, encourages a design-first, test-first, maintain-first mindset. 
Our code should reflect principles instantiated by machine classes because our thinking should reflect principles enacted by machine structures.

"Tube-Based Design", "TBD", and "Samstraumr" are more or less interchangable ideas, with Samstraumr technically being one way of implementing TBD.
 
Thanks are given to the machine metaphor as a way of thinking and managing goals by Ray Dalio and the team at Bridgewater Associates.

## What is Samstraumr?

Samstraumr is a framework for software engineering designed to help individuals and teams think through a design and implement adaptable, scalable systems in a straightforward and efficient manner. Imagine a toolkit that allows you to build complex systems, just like assembling a LEGO set, where each piece can easily connect and interact with others. 

At its core, Samstraumr embraces the principles of modular design, which means that each component—like a piece of software or a specific function—can work independently while also collaborating with others. This allows for flexibility, efficiency, and ease of maintenance.

Whether you're a developer, a student, or just someone curious about technology, Samstraumr offers a way to engage with systems in a more intuitive manner, making complex tasks simpler and more enjoyable.


## What is Samstraumr's Vision for the Future?

Samstraumr aims to redefine how we approach software development and system design. The vision is to create a world where individuals and teams can collaborate seamlessly, regardless of their technical backgrounds. By simplifying the complexities of system architecture, Samstraumr empowers users to focus on creativity and innovation rather than getting bogged down by technical hurdles.

### Purpose
The purpose of Samstraumr is to provide a robust framework that encourages:
- **Modularity:** Breaking down systems into smaller, manageable components that can be developed and maintained independently.
- **Adaptability:** Allowing systems to evolve and grow in response to changing needs and environments.

Through these efforts, Samstraumr aspires to create a vibrant ecosystem where creative coding can be well-structured and understandable well into the future.

## Technical Architectural Tenets and Fundamental Principles

Samstraumr operates on a set of guiding principles and architectural tenets designed to foster innovation, collaboration, and efficiency. These principles are foundational to the framework and inform every aspect of its design.

### Key Tenets

1. **Modularity:** 
   - Systems are composed of independent, self-contained components (or "tubes") that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This modularity allows for easier updates and enhancements without disrupting the entire system.

2. **Interoperability:** 
   - Samstraumr encourages the integration of various programming languages and technologies, promoting a polyglot environment. This enables teams to leverage the best tools for their specific tasks, regardless of the language.

3. **Feedback Loops:**
   - Continuous feedback is integral to the development process. Samstraumr supports mechanisms for real-time feedback on system performance, allowing teams to iterate quickly and improve their solutions.

4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - By prioritizing testing from the outset, Samstraumr helps ensure code reliability and maintainability. TDD practices are woven into the development process, encouraging developers to write tests alongside their code.

5. **Scalability:**
   - The architecture is designed to scale seamlessly, allowing systems to grow in complexity and size without significant rework. This adaptability is crucial in today's fast-paced development environments.

6. **Simplicity and Clarity:**
   - Samstraumr emphasizes simplicity in design and implementation. Clear and understandable code fosters better collaboration among team members and makes onboarding new developers easier.

### The Seven Sisters of Samstraumr

At the heart of the Samstraumr framework is Yggdrasil, the queen tube class that embodies the essence of interconnectedness and flow. She nurtures her six sisters, each with a vital role in maintaining the harmony and efficiency of the system. These sisters are designed to ensure that good outcomes are upheld and bad outcomes are mitigated. As developers create their applications, their classes inherit from Yggdrasil, allowing the sisters to be replicated and scaled according to the system's needs and abilities.

Andromeda: The seeker of knowledge, Andromeda gathers and validates input data. She ensures that all information flowing into the system is accurate and structured, setting the foundation for effective processing.

Calypso: The guardian of communication, Calypso facilitates interaction between tubes. She manages the messages exchanged among sisters, ensuring that vital information is shared seamlessly to enhance collaboration.

Freya: The weaver of causality, Freya analyzes relationships between data streams. She identifies patterns and correlations, helping the system predict outcomes and make informed decisions.

Maia: The nurturer of performance, Maia monitors resource usage and system health. She adjusts operations to optimize efficiency, ensuring that the system operates smoothly and sustainably.

Phoebe: The memory keeper, Phoebe recalls past interactions and insights. She provides context to the system's operations, allowing for better decision-making based on historical data.

Serena: The ethical overseer, Serena evaluates actions against ethical standards. She ensures that all operations align with the core values of the framework, maintaining integrity and responsibility.
