# Bash Script Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the bash script refactoring work completed to improve organization and maintenance of scripts in the Samstraumr project.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Demo Command Infrastructure**
   - Created a new `demo` command in the `s8r` CLI for running demonstration scripts
   - Added `show_demo_help()` and `handle_demo_command()` functions to handle demo operations
   - Updated the main help to include the demo command in examples

2. **Created Demo Scripts Directory**
   - Created a new directory: `/util/bin/demo/` for demonstration scripts
   - Moved `inspect-identity.sh` from project root to `/util/bin/demo/tube-identity-demo.sh`
   - Renamed the script with a clearer, more descriptive name following naming conventions

3. **Script Cleanup**
   - Removed scripts from the project root directory
   - Ensured all scripts are properly executable (`chmod +x`)
   - Maintained compatibility with existing functionality

## Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**
   - Project root directory is now cleaner
   - Scripts are logically organized by purpose
   - Standardized naming makes scripts easier to find

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Centralized location for demonstration scripts
   - Consistent CLI interface via the `s8r` command
   - Better separation of concerns

3. **User Experience**
   - Users can discover demos via `s8r demo list`
   - Help command shows available options
   - Consistent interface for all operations

## Usage Examples

```bash
# List available demos
./s8r demo list

# Run the tube identity demo
./s8r demo identity

# Get help on demo commands
./s8r help demo
```

## Future Work

1. **Additional Demos**
   - Add more demonstration scripts for key concepts
   - Consider adding documentation-specific demos
   - Add demos for new features as they are developed

2. **Demo Categories**
   - Organize demos into categories for better discovery
   - Add support for filtering demos by category
   - Allow listing demos with descriptions

3. **Integration with Documentation**
   - Link demos to relevant documentation
   - Add explanation comments in demo scripts
   - Consider adding step-by-step tutorials alongside demos
