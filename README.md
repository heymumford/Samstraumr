## What is Samstraumr?

* Samstraumr is a design framework based on a 'tube' structure, modeled on biological systems that process inputs and produce outcomes.
* Each tube represents a microsystem that continuously or periodically takes in time-series data or scalar/vector inputs, processes them, and produces outcomes.
* Each tube has a specific purpose that drives its behavior and outcomes. Tubes can combine with other tubes to create nearly anything.
* A tube's behavior can change or remain constant, depending on its sensitivity to interactions with other tubes or external inputs.
* Unlike rigid, single-use, or linear programming models, tube-based design allows for systems that "wiggle"—meaning they adapt, evolve, and respond dynamically to changes. 
* Samstraumr acts as a living blueprint, empowering systems with adaptive behaviors and self-awareness, transforming traditionally mechanistic constructs into responsive, living components.

## Why This Work Fuels My Joy

Most code I've written professionally has been test automation code bound by the time, scope, and resources of a project plan. Many tasks I've had have been some tradeoff of dealing with a program urgency or emergency created by an unseeable event or another person's lack of planning or foresight. I've dreamt of designing a computing framework that emits glimmers of the bits of world I find elegant. For me, Samstraumr is my evolving attempt at creating such a framework, extensible to all modern programming languages. My dream is that this framework finds applications useful to humanity, and that such applications outlive me.

Some highlights of my goals:

*Modularity:* Independent components ('tubes') that work together, allowing for flexible updates and easy maintenance, reducing complexity and technical debt without disrupting the entire system.

*Self-Correction:* Systems with built-in quality controls that monitor performance, adjust based on real-time feedback, and scale as needed without manual intervention.

*Collaboration:* Interdependent components ('tubes') interact dynamically, creating new functionalities by sharing data and processes—much like instruments in a symphony producing a cohesive sound.

*Resilience:* Systems that can recover from failures, optimize resource use, and adapt to new conditions, all while maintaining coherence and stability.


## TLDR: A Thoughtful Approach to Adaptive Computation

Samstraumr is a design framework built on the concept of tubes: modular components inspired by natural systems. These tubes process inputs, generate outcomes, and interact with other tubes to form adaptable, responsive systems that can evolve with their environment.

At its core, Samstraumr offers a fundamental set of tube types, such as Amplifiers for boosting signals or Reducers for distilling complex inputs. Each tube contributes a specific function, and together, they create systems that can adjust and grow in response to changing conditions.

We’re quietly testing Samstraumr across a range of applications, from neuroscience and quantum computing to thermodynamic simulations and financial modeling. Each domain provides a unique opportunity to explore how these tubes can work together to solve complex challenges.

The framework is flexible, with Java21 as its foundation, but it’s designed to work seamlessly across languages like Python, R, and industry-specific tools such as SPICE or CFD. While Samstraumr is still evolving, we're hopeful that its understated approach will speak through the results it produces.
