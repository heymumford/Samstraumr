# Samstraumr

## Pronunciation
In English, "Samstraumr" can be pronounced as "SAHM-strahm-ur" (where "Sam" rhymes with "calm," "straum" sounds like "strom" with a softer "a," and "ur" sounds like "er" in "water").

## 10-Second Overview
"Samstraumr" / "S8r" is a modular, adaptable design framework for building scalable, resilient software using Tube-Based Design principles.

- **WHO**: Developed by E. C. Mumford, Samstraumr is designed for engineers seeking intuitive, future-proof code.
- **WHAT**: Organizes code into self-contained "Tubes" that interact dynamically, simplifying development and maintenance.
- **WHY**: Reduces technical debt and complexity, making code easier to update and scale over time.
- **WHEN**: Ideal for any project where long-term maintainability and adaptability are priorities.
- **WHERE**: Test automation frameworks are the prime target of Samstraumr, as you can almost always implement a lightweight, practical test automation approach to designing tests and test data for systems.
- **HOW**: In the language of your choice, design clear, modular structures with well-defined interactions, creating functional, efficient, and resilient transformations of data and outcomes.

## Meaning and Core Philosophy
Samstraumr encapsulates the philosophy of "The Flow of Unity." It represents the harmonious flow of interconnected components working together as a unified whole. This approach to software design focuses on modularity, dynamic interactions, and resilience, drawing inspiration from natural systems where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

For more details on the core philosophy, see the [Core Philosophy Document](docs/concepts/core-philosophy.md).

## What Samstraumr Is Not
Samstraumr is not a replacement for traditional programming paradigms but a complementary mindset that enhances the ability to create modular, adaptable, and resilient systems.

## Tube-Based Coding Principles
Tube-Based Design organizes code into modular, self-contained components called "Tubes." These Tubes interact dynamically, allowing for more intuitive, maintainable, and scalable code.

To dive deeper into Tube-Based Coding Principles, see the [Tube-Based Coding Principles Document](docs/guides/tube-based-coding-principles.md).

## Basic Structures in Tube-Based Design
- **Tubes**: The fundamental building blocks, representing specific functions or processes.
- **Connectors**: Manage the flow of data or signals between Tubes.
- **Mediums**: The environment through which signals or data flow.
- **Signals**: The data or energy that flows through the Tubes.
- **Interfaces**: Define how other Tubes interact with each Tube.

For more on the basic structures, refer to the [Basic Structures Document](docs/concepts/basic-structures.md).
