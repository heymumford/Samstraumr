## What is Samstraumr?

* Samstraumr is a design framework based on a 'tube' structure, modeled on biological systems that process inputs and produce outcomes.
* Each tube represents a system that continuously or periodically takes in time-series data or scalar/vector inputs, processes them, and produces outcomes.
* Each tube has a specific purpose that drives its behavior and outcomes.
* A tube's behavior can change or remain constant, depending on its sensitivity to interactions with other tubes or external inputs.
* Unlike rigid, single-use, or linear programming models, tube-based design allows for systems that "wiggle"—meaning they adapt, evolve, and respond dynamically to changes. 
* Samstraumr acts as a living blueprint, empowering systems with adaptive behaviors and self-awareness, transforming traditionally mechanistic constructs into responsive, living components.

## Why This Work Fuels My Joy

Most code I've written professionally has been bound by the time, scope, and resources of a project plan. I've dreamt of designing a computing framework that emits glimmers of the bits of world I find elegant. For me, Samstraumr is my evolving attempt at creating such a framework, extensible to all modern programming languages. My dream is that this framework finds applications useful to humanity, and that such applications outlive me.

Some highlights of my goals:

*Modularity:* Independent components ('tubes') that work together, allowing for flexible updates and easy maintenance, reducing complexity and technical debt without disrupting the entire system.

*Self-Correction:* Systems with built-in quality controls that monitor performance, adjust based on real-time feedback, and scale as needed without manual intervention.

*Collaboration:* Interdependent components ('tubes') interact dynamically, creating new functionalities by sharing data and processes—much like instruments in a symphony producing a cohesive sound.

*Resilience:* Systems that can recover from failures, optimize resource use, and adapt to new conditions, all while maintaining coherence and stability.

Explore examples and see how Samstraumr can bring flexibility and adaptability to your software. Build code that grows and evolves—without endless meetings and headaches.
