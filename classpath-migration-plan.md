# Package Migration Plan: Standardizing on `org.s8r`

## Analysis

After analyzing the codebase, we have identified three primary package naming patterns:

1. **`org.s8r.*`** - Already using the shortened form (preferred direction)
2. **`org.samstraumr.*`** - Using the full name (needs migration)
3. **`org.tube.*`** - Legacy package structure (needs migration)

We verified that `s8r` is a valid package name in Java (numeric characters are allowed in package names).

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Create Mapping Document

1. Create a detailed mapping of package renames:
   - `org.samstraumr.*` → `org.s8r.*`
   - `org.tube.*` → `org.s8r.tube.*`

2. Preserve the existing logical structure:
   - Clean Architecture layers
   - Domain segregation
   - Current package hierarchies

### Phase 2: Update Source Files

1. Create a migration script to:
   - Update package declarations
   - Update import statements
   - Move files to new locations

2. Script will preserve:
   - File content except for package declarations
   - Class/method signatures and implementations
   - Documentation

### Phase 3: Update Build Files

1. Update Maven POMs to reflect new package structure
2. Ensure all dependency references use updated package names

### Phase 4: Test and Verify

1. Run unit tests to verify functionality
2. Run integration tests to ensure components work together
3. Verify all tests pass after migration

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement this migration using a combination of:

1. Automated scripts to handle the bulk of the package renames
2. Manual verification of key classes and interfaces
3. Incremental commits to ensure traceability

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Testing Risk**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage during migration
2. **Dependency Risk**: Update any package references in external libraries
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Consider providing temporary adapter classes for critical interfaces

## Timeline

1. Phase 1 (Mapping Document): 1 day
2. Phase 2 (Update Source Files): 2-3 days
3. Phase 3 (Update Build Files): 1 day
4. Phase 4 (Test and Verify): 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 5-7 days

## Conclusion

Standardizing on `org.s8r` as the root package will create a more consistent codebase that's easier to navigate and maintain. The numeric shortening (s8r = samstraumr) is valid in Java and follows common industry practices for package abbreviation.
