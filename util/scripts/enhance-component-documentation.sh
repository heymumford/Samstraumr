# Component Layer

This directory contains the component abstractions that form the foundation of the S8r framework.

## Package Organization

The component layer uses a standard package structure that organizes classes by responsibility:

- `org.s8r.component.core` - Core component interfaces and abstractions
  - `Component.java` - The fundamental component interface
  - `Environment.java` - Environment configuration for components
  - `State.java` - Component state management

- `org.s8r.component.composite` - Composite component implementation
  - `Composite.java` - Container for multiple components
  - `CompositeFactory.java` - Factory for creating composite components

- `org.s8r.component.identity` - Identity management
  - `Identity.java` - Component identity interface

- `org.s8r.component.machine` - Machine component implementation
  - `Machine.java` - Component orchestration
  - `MachineFactory.java` - Factory for creating machines

- `org.s8r.component.exception` - Component-related exceptions
  - `ComponentException.java` - Base class for component exceptions
  - `InvalidStateTransitionException.java` - State transition errors

- `org.s8r.component.logging` - Component logging
  - `Logger.java` - Component logging interface

## Design Patterns

The component layer implements several key design patterns:
- Composite Pattern: Allows treating individual objects and compositions uniformly
- Factory Pattern: Provides interfaces for creating objects without specifying concrete classes
- Identity Pattern: Provides unique identification and addressing for components
- State Pattern: Manages component lifecycle states

## Related Packages

- `org.s8r.domain.component` - Domain model implementation of components
- `org.s8r.application.service` - Application services that use components
- `org.s8r.infrastructure.persistence` - Repository implementations for components
