# Source Code Flattening Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the specific implementation steps for Phase 5 of the directory flattening plan: Source Code Simplification.

## Current Structure Analysis

Our source code currently has several small directories with fewer than 5 files, leading to excessive nesting and fragmentation:

```
samstraumr-core/src/main/java/org/s8r/
  domain/
    component/
      composite/ (4 files)
        Composite.java
        CompositeException.java
        CompositeFactory.java
        package-info.java
      identity/ (2 files)
        Identity.java
        package-info.java
      lifecycle/ (1 file)
        LifecycleState.java
    event/
      small-subdirectories/...
    exception/
      small-subdirectories/...
```

## Target Structure

The target structure consolidates small directories using file naming conventions:

```
samstraumr-core/src/main/java/org/s8r/
  domain/
    component/ 
      Component.java
      ComponentException.java
      CompositeComponent.java
      CompositeComponentFactory.java
      package-info.java
    event/
      ComponentEvent.java
      MachineEvent.java
      ...
    identity/
      ComponentIdentity.java
      IdentityConverter.java
      ...
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Component Domain Consolidation

1. Move and rename files from `domain/component/composite/` to `domain/component/`:
   - `Composite.java` → `CompositeComponent.java`
   - `CompositeException.java` → `CompositeComponentException.java`
   - `CompositeFactory.java` → `CompositeComponentFactory.java`

2. Update package declarations in all moved files.

3. Update import statements in all dependent files.

### 2. Event Domain Consolidation

1. Consolidate event directories with appropriate prefixes:
   - `component/events/` → `event/Component*.java`
   - `machine/events/` → `event/Machine*.java`

2. Update package declarations and imports.

### 3. Identity Consolidation

1. Consolidate identity-related classes:
   - `domain/identity/*.java` → `domain/identity/`
   - `domain/component/identity/*.java` → `domain/identity/Component*.java`

2. Update package declarations and imports.

### 4. Infrastructure Consolidation

Apply similar patterns to infrastructure layer directories with fewer than 5 files.

## Implementation Sequence

To minimize disruption and ensure incremental testing:

1. Begin with leaf packages that have no dependencies
2. Move through the hierarchy, testing after each step
3. Handle cross-cutting concerns last

## Verification Plan

After each consolidation step:

1. Run `mvn compile` to verify compilation
2. Run unit tests for affected components
3. Run integration tests to verify larger system behavior
4. Update documentation as needed

## Backward Compatibility

During the transition period:

1. Consider using package forwarding where needed
2. Add appropriate @Deprecated annotations on old paths
3. Document changes in release notes

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation:

1. Overall directory depth reduced from max 13 to max 9 levels
2. Number of directories reduced by approximately 40%
3. Improved code discoverability through consistent naming
4. Simplified navigation and improved IDE performance

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking changes to the API | Carefully preserve public API signatures |
| Compilation failures | Incremental testing approach |
| Missing import updates | Use IDE refactoring tools to catch missed imports |
| Circular dependencies | Analyze and break any circular dependencies before consolidation |
