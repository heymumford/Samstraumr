# Filename: build-optimal.sh
# Purpose: Provides optimized Maven build configuration for Samstraumr with flexible build modes.
# Goals:
#   - Ensure that builds are executed with optimized memory and thread settings
#   - Ensure that different build modes (fast, compile, test) are easily accessible
#   - Ensure that project structure and Java version compatibility are properly handled
# Dependencies:
#   - Maven build system with appropriate profiles
#   - setup-java17-compat.sh for version compatibility
#   - Project structure with standard Maven layout
# Assumptions:
#   - Script may be called from different locations relative to project root
#   - Maven is installed and properly configured in the environment
#   - The fast profile is defined in the project POM files
#
# Usage: ./build-optimal.sh [clean] [fast|compile|test] [additional maven flags]
