# Observability Testing Strategy for Samstraumr

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for testing observability within the Samstraumr framework. It builds upon the overall testing strategy while focusing specifically on ensuring systems are transparent, debuggable, and monitorable in production environments across all implementation languages.

## Observability Principles

1. **Intrinsic Observability**: Components should be self-aware and capable of reporting their own state.

2. **Extrinsic Observability**: External systems should be able to observe and monitor components.

3. **Multi-level Visibility**: Observability should be available at all levels of the architecture (component, composite, machine, system).

4. **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Observability spans all aspects of the system and should be tested holistically.

5. **Language Agnostic**: Observability patterns should work consistently across all implementation languages.

## Three Pillars of Observability Testing

### 1. Logs Testing

**Purpose**: Verify that components produce appropriate and useful log output.

**Test Aspects**:
- Log message correctness
- Log level appropriateness
- Contextual information inclusion
- Error details capture
- Log format consistency

**Test Approaches**:
- Capture and analyze log output during test execution
- Verify specific log messages for key operations
- Check error conditions produce appropriate logs
- Validate structured logging format
- Test log correlation (e.g., trace IDs)

**Example Tests**:
```java
@Test
void shouldLogComponentInitialization() {
    // Given
    TestLogCaptor logCaptor = new TestLogCaptor();
    Component component = new Component("test-component");
    
    // When
    component.initialize();
    
    // Then
    assertThat(logCaptor.getInfoLogs())
        .contains("Component test-component initialized");
    assertThat(logCaptor.getStructuredLogs())
        .hasFieldWithValue("componentId", "test-component")
        .hasFieldWithValue("lifecycle", "initialized");
}
```

### 2. Metrics Testing

**Purpose**: Verify that components expose appropriate metrics for monitoring.

**Test Aspects**:
- Metric registration
- Metric value accuracy
- Metric label correctness
- Counter/gauge/histogram behavior
- Custom metric validation

**Test Approaches**:
- Capture and analyze metrics during test execution
- Simulate operations and verify metric changes
- Test metric registration at startup
- Validate metric labels and dimensions
- Verify metric type appropriateness

**Example Tests**:
```java
@Test
void shouldTrackActiveComponents() {
    // Given
    TestMetricsRegistry registry = new TestMetricsRegistry();
    ComponentFactory factory = new ComponentFactory(registry);
    
    // When
    Component component1 = factory.createComponent("test-1");
    Component component2 = factory.createComponent("test-2");
    component1.activate();
    
    // Then
    assertThat(registry.getGauge("samstraumr_active_components"))
        .hasValue(1)
        .hasLabel("type", "component");
}
```

### 3. Tracing Testing

**Purpose**: Verify that components properly propagate and generate traces.

**Test Aspects**:
- Span creation
- Trace propagation
- Span attributes
- Error annotation
- Trace context management

**Test Approaches**:
- Capture and analyze trace spans during test execution
- Verify parent-child span relationships
- Test trace context propagation across boundaries
- Validate span attributes and events
- Check error conditions are properly annotated

**Example Tests**:
```java
@Test
void shouldPropagateTraceContext() {
    // Given
    TestTracer tracer = new TestTracer();
    Component parent = new Component("parent", tracer);
    Component child = new Component("child", tracer);
    
    // When
    parent.connectTo(child);
    parent.processWithChild("test-data");
    
    // Then
    assertThat(tracer.getSpans())
        .hasSize(2)
        .hasSpanWithName("parent.process")
        .hasChildSpan("child.process");
    assertThat(tracer.getSpanAttributes("child.process"))
        .hasAttribute("data.size", 9);
}
```

## Testing Across Architecture Layers

### L0: Component Observability

**Key Tests**:
- Component initialization and state change logging
- Component-level metrics registration and updating
- Basic trace creation within components
- Error handling and observability

**Example Scenario**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Component errors are properly observable
  Given a component with observability enabled
  When an error occurs during processing
  Then an error log should be generated with exception details
  And the error_count metric should be incremented
  And the current span should be marked as errored with error details
```

### L1: Composite Observability

**Key Tests**:
- Log correlation across components within a composite
- Aggregated metrics for composites
- Trace propagation between components
- Composite-specific observability aspects

**Example Scenario**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Trace propagation within a composite
  Given a composite with multiple connected components
  When a data flow process executes across components
  Then each component should create child spans
  And the trace context should be propagated across all components
  And the composite should have an enclosing parent span
```

### L2: Machine Observability

**Key Tests**:
- Cross-composite trace propagation
- System-wide metrics aggregation
- Complex workflow observability
- Machine-level health indicators

**Example Scenario**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Machine execution is fully observable
  Given a machine orchestrating multiple composites
  When the machine executes a complex workflow
  Then the entire execution path should be traceable
  And machine-level metrics should reflect the processing
  And aggregated logs should provide a coherent execution narrative
```

### L3: System Observability

**Key Tests**:
- End-to-end trace visibility
- System-wide health metrics
- Cross-boundary observability
- Alerting condition validation

**Example Scenario**:
```gherkin
Scenario: System health is properly observable
  Given a complete system with multiple machines
  When the system processes end-to-end workflows
  Then system health metrics should be properly aggregated
  And resource utilization should be correctly reported
  And predefined alerting conditions should trigger appropriately
```

## Conclusion

This observability testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring Samstraumr components and systems are properly observable in production. By systematically testing logging, metrics, and tracing across all architecture layers, we can ensure that operators have the visibility they need to monitor, debug, and maintain Samstraumr-based applications.

The strategy aligns with our broader testing approach while focusing specifically on the critical cross-cutting concern of observability, ensuring that our systems are not just functionally correct but also transparent and monitorable in real-world deployments.
