# Samstraumr Test Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Samstraumr framework, detailing our approach across all layers of the test pyramid. It establishes clear goals, methodologies, and completeness criteria to ensure our testing efforts align with architectural principles and deliver reliable, observable, and maintainable software across all polyglot implementations.

## Core Testing Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Tests are written before implementation to guide design and ensure requirements are met.

2. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Feature files capture business requirements in human-readable format, bridging technical and domain knowledge.

3. **Layered Verification**: Each architectural layer has specific testing approaches tailored to its unique concerns.

4. **Completeness by Design**: Test suites are considered complete when they verify all specified behaviors, handle edge cases, and maintain independence.

5. **Polyglot Compatibility**: Testing patterns work consistently across all implementation languages (Java, Kotlin, Python, etc.).

6. **Observability Integration**: Tests verify not just functionality but also observability mechanisms, ensuring systems are transparent in production.

### Language-Specific Adaptations

1. **Java/Kotlin**:
   - JUnit 5 for unit and integration tests
   - Cucumber for BDD scenarios
   - Mockito for mocking
   - AssertJ for assertions

2. **Python**:
   - Pytest for unit and integration tests
   - Behave for BDD scenarios
   - Unittest.mock for mocking
   - Pytest assertions

3. **JavaScript/TypeScript**:
   - Jest for unit and integration tests
   - Cucumber.js for BDD scenarios
   - Jest mocking
   - Jest assertions

## Test Automation and CI/CD Integration

Our test automation strategy ensures tests are continuously executed:

1. **Fast Feedback**: Core unit tests run on every commit.

2. **Staged Testing**: Heavier tests run at appropriate stages of CI/CD.

3. **Quality Gates**: Tests serve as quality gates for progression.

4. **Artifact Validation**: Tests validate built artifacts before deployment.

## Readiness Assessment

To determine if our test suites are complete and ready, we use the following checklist:

### Readiness Criteria

1. ✅ **Functional Completeness**: All specified behaviors are tested.

2. ✅ **Layer Coverage**: Tests exist at all levels of the test pyramid.
