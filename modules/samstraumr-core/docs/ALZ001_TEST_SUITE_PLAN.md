# ALZ001 Test Suite Plan: Alzheimer's Disease Modeling in Samstraumr

## 1. Purpose and Vision

### Primary Goals

The ALZ001 test suite serves multiple critical purposes that extend beyond typical software testing:

1. **Biological System Simulation**: Demonstrate Samstraumr's capability to model complex biological systems with emergent behaviors, focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.

2. **Architecture Validation**: Stress-test Samstraumr's tube-composite-machine architecture with a demanding real-world use case that requires multi-scale modeling, from molecular interactions to systemic behaviors.

3. **Discovery Platform**: Create a framework that could potentially lead to novel insights about AD mechanisms and therapeutic approaches through emergent behaviors in the simulation.

4. **Scientific Application**: Show how Samstraumr can be applied to scientific research, particularly in areas where complex system modeling is essential.

5. **TDD Framework**: Establish a comprehensive suite of BDD/TDD tests that validate the framework's capabilities while also serving as examples for developers creating their own domain-specific models.

### Scientific Potential

While primarily developed as a test suite, the ALZ001 implementation has genuine scientific potential:

- **Hypothesis Generation**: By simulating the complex interplay of factors in AD, the system could generate testable hypotheses that researchers might not have considered.

- **Integration of Disparate Data**: The system can integrate knowledge from different research domains (molecular biology, neuroscience, clinical medicine) into a cohesive model.

- **Treatment Strategy Simulation**: Allow for rapid in-silico testing of potential intervention strategies before expensive clinical trials.

- **Personalized Medicine Approach**: Enable modeling of disease progression based on individual patient characteristics.

Feature: Protein Expression in Alzheimer's Disease Model
  As an Alzheimer's researcher
  I want to model protein expression and aggregation
  So that I can understand amyloid and tau pathology development

  Scenario: Model amyloid-beta aggregation over time
