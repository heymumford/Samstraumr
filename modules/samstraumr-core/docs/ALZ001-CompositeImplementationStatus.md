# ALZ001 Composite Implementation Status

## Progress Overview

As part of the Phase 2 implementation of the ALZ001 test suite, we have begun implementing the composite layer for Alzheimer's disease modeling in Samstraumr. The composite layer coordinates multiple components to provide higher-level functionality.

## Completed

1. **ALZ001MockComposite** base class
   - Provides common functionality for all composites
   - Manages child components and connections
   - Handles lifecycle operations
   - Implements validation mechanisms

2. **ProteinExpressionComposite**
   - Coordinates multiple protein expression components
   - Implements protein interaction networks
   - Models cellular compartments for protein localization
   - Simulates protein transport between compartments
   - Provides multi-protein aggregation simulation with cross-seeding
   - Generates integrated protein profiles across components

3. **Factory Methods**
   - Added methods to ALZ001MockFactory for creating composites
   - Implemented configurations for protein expression composites
   - Created utility methods for fully configured composites

4. **Test Implementation**
   - Created feature file for protein expression composite testing
   - Implemented step definitions with Given/When/Then steps
   - Added assertions for composite validation

## In Progress

1. **NeuronalNetworkComposite**
   - Will coordinate multiple neuronal network components
   - Will implement network interaction patterns
   - Will model hierarchical network structures

2. **TimeSeriesAnalysisComposite**
   - Will coordinate multiple time series analysis components
   - Will implement cross-series analysis
   - Will provide pattern recognition across multiple series

3. **EnvironmentalFactorsComposite**
   - Will coordinate multiple environmental factor components
   - Will model interaction between environmental factors
   - Will simulate intervention strategies

4. **PredictiveModelingComposite**
   - Will coordinate multiple predictive modeling components
   - Will implement ensemble prediction
   - Will provide comparative analysis of prediction strategies

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Remaining Composites**
   - Complete the implementation of the four remaining composite types
   - Ensure each composite has appropriate factory methods
   - Create feature files for testing each composite

2. **Enhance Integration Testing**
   - Create tests for interaction between different composite types
   - Implement cross-composite data flow
   - Validate composite interactions against scientific expectations

3. **Prepare for Machine Layer**
   - Design interfaces for machine layer implementation
   - Create initial machine layer tests
   - Plan integration between composites and machines

## Scientific Applications

The composite layer enables more sophisticated modeling of Alzheimer's disease mechanisms:

1. **Multi-scale Interactions**
   - Protein-network interactions
   - Cross-compartment processes
   - Environmental-biological feedback loops

2. **Emergent Behaviors**
   - Complex temporal patterns
   - Non-linear system dynamics
   - Compensatory mechanisms

3. **Intervention Analysis**
   - Multi-target intervention strategies
   - Timing-dependent effects
   - Personalized intervention plans

By completing the composite layer, we will establish a foundation for the machine layer, which will provide even more sophisticated modeling capabilities for Alzheimer's disease research.
