Feature: Tube Pre-Conception Phase Tests
  As a system architect
  I want to verify the tube's earliest pre-conception phase
  So that the complete lifecycle model is properly represented from the very beginning

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured

@Functional  @SubstrateOrigin @PreConception @Identity @Positive
  Scenario: Environment provides essential prerequisites for tube creation
    When the environment is evaluated for tube creation
    Then the environment should have a stable configuration
    And the environment should have resource allocation capabilities
    And the environment should provide isolation boundaries
    And the environment should have identity generation mechanisms

@Functional  @SubstrateOrigin @PreConception @Identity @Positive
  Scenario: Creation request captures tube origin intent
    When a tube creation request is prepared
    Then the request should contain a creation purpose
    And the request should specify required resources
    And the request should indicate the intended lifespan
    And the request should define the interaction model

@Functional  @SubstrateOrigin @PreConception @Identity @Validation @Positive
  Scenario: Creation request validation ensures integrity
    When a tube creation request is validated
    Then the request should be checked for completeness
    And the request should be evaluated for resource availability
    And the request should be analyzed for potential conflicts
    And a successful validation should produce a creation template

@Functional  @SubstrateOrigin @PreConception @Identity @ResourceAcquisition @Positive
  Scenario: Resources are allocated before conception
    Given a valid tube creation request exists
    When resources are allocated for tube creation
    Then memory resources should be reserved
    And identity resources should be prepared
    And environmental context should be captured
    And initialization parameters should be established

@Functional  @SubstrateOrigin @PreConception @Identity @Negative
  Scenario: Tube creation fails with insufficient resources
    Given the environment has limited resources
    When a tube creation request exceeds available resources
    Then the creation process should be rejected
    And appropriate error information should be provided
    And no partial tube structure should remain
    And resources should be properly released
