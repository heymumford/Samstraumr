@L3_System @Functional @Acceptance @TubeAcceptance @ATL
Feature: Tube System Acceptance Tests
  As a system architect
  I want to verify that tubes function correctly at the system level
  So that I can trust their reliability in production environments

  Background:
    Given the S8r framework is initialized
    And a complete tube system is configured

  @smoke @Identity
  Scenario: Tube system establishes complete identity hierarchy
    When I create a multi-level tube system
    Then each tube should have a valid hierarchical identity
    And identity queries should resolve correctly through the hierarchy
    And lineage information should be preserved
    And temporal identity markers should be established

  @Functional @DataFlow @Transformer
  Scenario: Tube system processes data through transformation chain
    Given the following input data:
      | input_id | content_type | payload_size | priority |
      | IN001    | JSON         | 1024         | high     |
      | IN002    | XML          | 2048         | medium   |
      | IN003    | Binary       | 4096         | low      |
    When I process the data through the tube transformation system
    Then all data items should be completely processed
    And each transformation phase should be recorded in the tube journal
    And output validation should confirm data integrity
    And processing metrics should be collected

  @Functional @Knowledge @MimirJournal
  Scenario: Tube system maintains comprehensive Mimir journal
    Given a tube system processing continuous data streams
    When the system operates for 100 time units
    Then the Mimir journal should contain timestamped entries
    And critical environmental events should be recorded with high priority
    And the journal should maintain cross-references between related events
    And knowledge patterns should begin to emerge from recurring events

  @Functional @Environment @Adaptation
  Scenario: Tube system adapts to changing environmental conditions
    Given a tube system operating in stable conditions
    When the following environmental changes occur:
      | condition    | initial_value | new_value | change_rate |
      | resource     | abundant      | scarce    | gradual     |
      | stability    | stable        | unstable  | sudden      |
      | connectivity | high          | low       | fluctuating |
    Then the tube system should detect each environmental change
    And appropriate adaptive responses should be triggered
    And system performance should remain within acceptable parameters
    And the adaptation events should be recorded in the Mimir journal

  @Functional @SurvivalStrategy
  Scenario: Tube system selects appropriate survival strategy based on environment
    Given a tube system with mixed environmental conditions
    When environmental favorability drops below critical threshold
    Then immortality strategy should be selected for essential components
    And when environmental favorability improves above threshold
    Then reproduction strategy should be selected for non-essential components
    And strategy selection events should be recorded in the decision log

  @Functional @SurvivalStrategy @KnowledgeTransfer
  Scenario: Tube system transfers knowledge during reproduction
    Given a mature tube system with accumulated knowledge
    When reproduction is triggered for selected tubes
    Then essential knowledge should be transferred to offspring tubes
    And transferred knowledge should maintain semantic integrity
    And offspring tubes should demonstrate behavioral continuity
    And parent tubes should transition to appropriate post-reproduction state

  @Functional @ErrorHandling @Resilience
  Scenario: Tube system handles component failures gracefully
    Given a complex tube system with redundant components
    When critical component failures are simulated:
      | component_type | failure_mode       | system_phase |
      | transformer    | sudden termination | processing   |
      | observer       | gradual degradation| monitoring   |
      | coordinator    | connection loss    | orchestration|
    Then the system should detect each component failure
    And recovery procedures should be initiated
    And system functionality should be maintained or gracefully degraded
    And failure events should be properly recorded for analysis

  @Functional @Performance @ScaleTesting
  Scenario Outline: Tube system scales under varying loads
    Given a tube system configured for <scale> scale operation
    When subjected to <load_pattern> load pattern with <concurrent_streams> concurrent streams
    And operating for <duration> time units
    Then system throughput should exceed <min_throughput> items per time unit
    And response latency should remain below <max_latency> time units
    And resource utilization should peak below <max_resource_usage>% capacity
    And error rate should remain below <max_error_rate>%

    Examples:
      | scale    | load_pattern | concurrent_streams | duration | min_throughput | max_latency | max_resource_usage | max_error_rate |
      | small    | steady       | 10                 | 100      | 100            | 0.5         | 60                 | 0.1            |
      | medium   | steady       | 50                 | 100      | 400            | 1.0         | 70                 | 0.5            |
      | large    | steady       | 200                | 100      | 1500           | 2.0         | 80                 | 1.0            |
      | small    | bursty       | 20                 | 100      | 50             | 1.0         | 75                 | 0.2            |
      | medium   | bursty       | 100                | 100      | 200            | 2.0         | 85                 | 1.0            |
      | large    | bursty       | 400                | 100      | 750            | 4.0         | 95                 | 2.0            |
      | small    | cyclic       | 15                 | 100      | 75             | 0.7         | 65                 | 0.1            |
      | medium   | cyclic       | 75                 | 100      | 300            | 1.5         | 75                 | 0.7            |
      | large    | cyclic       | 300                | 100      | 1000           | 3.0         | 85                 | 1.5            |

  @Functional @Lifecycle @LongRunning
  Scenario: Tube system completes full lifecycle from creation to termination
    Given a new tube system with standard configuration
    When the system progresses through its complete lifecycle
    Then all lifecycle phases should execute in the correct sequence
    And appropriate resources should be allocated during active phases
    And all resources should be properly released during termination
    And the complete lifecycle journal should be available for analysis

  @Functional @SelfAwareness @PurposefulEnding
  Scenario: Tube system demonstrates self-awareness and purposeful ending
    Given a mature tube system with established identity
    When the system is instructed to prepare for termination
    Then the system should organize knowledge for preservation
    And essential functions should be prioritized during wind-down
    And knowledge transfer should be initiated to successor systems
    And termination should proceed in a controlled, purposeful manner

  @Functional @Integration @Compatibility
  Scenario: Tube system integrates correctly with external systems
    Given a tube system interfacing with the following external systems:
      | system_name | protocol  | data_format | interface_complexity |
      | DataStore   | REST      | JSON        | medium               |
      | Analytics   | GraphQL   | Custom      | high                 |
      | Monitoring  | WebSocket | Metrics     | low                  |
    When integration transactions are performed across all interfaces
    Then all transactions should complete successfully
    And data should flow bidirectionally as expected
    And the tube system should adapt to interface variations
    And integration metrics should be within operational parameters

  @Functional @Observability @MonitoringCapabilities
  Scenario: Tube system provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities
    Given a tube system with monitoring instrumentation
    When the system operates under mixed workload conditions
    Then real-time performance metrics should be continuously available
    And system state should be observable through monitoring interfaces
    And critical events should trigger appropriate notifications
    And historical performance data should be accessible for trend analysis

  @Security @DataProtection
  Scenario: Tube system enforces appropriate data protection measures
    Given a tube system processing sensitive information
    When the system handles data with varying classification levels:
      | classification | encryption_required | anonymization_required | retention_policy |
      | public         | no                  | no                     | standard         |
      | internal       | yes                 | partial                | extended         |
      | confidential   | yes                 | yes                    | minimal          |
    Then data protection measures should be correctly applied
    And access to protected data should be properly controlled
    And data handling should comply with protection policies
    And security events should be logged for audit purposes

  @Compliance @Auditability
  Scenario: Tube system maintains comprehensive audit trail
    Given a tube system operating in a regulated environment
    When the system processes audit-relevant transactions
    Then each transaction should be recorded with audit metadata
    And the audit trail should be tamper-evident
    And audit events should include actor, action, timestamp, and context
    And audit records should be retrievable based on multiple search criteria
