Feature: Tube Survival Strategy Selection (with Lucy Tests)
  As a framework developer
  I want tubes to select appropriate survival strategies based on environmental conditions
  So that they can optimize their existence through immortality or reproduction
  
  # The Lucy Tests explore deeper aspects of tube identity, consciousness, knowledge transfer
  # through time, and legacy creation - examining how tubes develop self-awareness and how
  # knowledge transforms from data to essence across generations

  Background:
    Given the S8r framework is initialized

  @smoke @SurvivalDecision
  Scenario: Tube chooses immortality in harsh environment
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state
    And the environment has the following conditions:
      | factor                | value   | threshold | classification |
      | resourceAvailability  | 2       | 5         | scarce         |
      | environmentalStability| 3       | 6         | unstable       |
      | hostilityLevel        | 7       | 5         | hostile        |
    When the tube evaluates its survival strategy
    Then the tube should choose "IMMORTALITY" strategy
    And the tube should enter "SELF_SUFFICIENCY" mode
    And the tube should optimize resource consumption
    And the tube should enable self-repair mechanisms
    And the decision should be logged with environmental factors

  @SurvivalDecision
  Scenario: Tube chooses reproduction in favorable environment
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state
    And the environment has the following conditions:
      | factor                | value   | threshold | classification |
      | resourceAvailability  | 8       | 5         | abundant       |
      | environmentalStability| 7       | 6         | stable         |
      | hostilityLevel        | 2       | 5         | benign         |
    When the tube evaluates its survival strategy
    Then the tube should choose "REPRODUCTION" strategy
    And the tube should prepare for offspring creation
    And the tube should organize knowledge transfer structures
    And the tube should allocate resources for reproduction
    And the decision should be logged with environmental factors

  @SurvivalDecision @EdgeCase
  Scenario: Tube reevaluates strategy when environment changes
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state with "IMMORTALITY" strategy
    And the environment initially has harsh conditions
    When the environment changes to favorable conditions:
      | factor                | oldValue | newValue | threshold | newClassification |
      | resourceAvailability  | 3        | 8        | 5         | abundant          |
      | environmentalStability| 4        | 7        | 6         | stable            |
      | hostilityLevel        | 6        | 3        | 5         | benign            |
    And the tube reevaluates its survival strategy
    Then the tube should switch to "REPRODUCTION" strategy
    And the tube should prepare for reproduction phase
    And the tube should log the strategy change with reasons

  @SurvivalDecision @EdgeCase
  Scenario: Tube reevaluates strategy when environment deteriorates
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state with "REPRODUCTION" strategy
    And the environment initially has favorable conditions
    When the environment changes to harsh conditions:
      | factor                | oldValue | newValue | threshold | newClassification |
      | resourceAvailability  | 7        | 3        | 5         | scarce            |
      | environmentalStability| 8        | 4        | 6         | unstable          |
      | hostilityLevel        | 2        | 7        | 5         | hostile           |
    And the tube reevaluates its survival strategy
    Then the tube should switch to "IMMORTALITY" strategy
    And the tube should abort reproduction preparations
    And the tube should reallocate resources to self-maintenance
    And the tube should log the strategy change with reasons

  @SurvivalDecision @KnowledgeTransfer
  Scenario: Tube transfers knowledge during reproduction
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state with "REPRODUCTION" strategy
    And the tube has accumulated the following knowledge:
      | knowledgeType         | priority | transferMethod        |
      | environmentalModel    | high     | directEncoding        |
      | resourceUtilization   | high     | parameterTransfer     |

      | errorRecovery         | high     | exceptionHandlers     |
      | optimizationHeuristics| medium   | algorithmicTransfer   |
    When the tube initiates reproduction
    Then knowledge transfer should occur in priority order
    And essential knowledge should be transferred with verification
    And the offspring should receive all high-priority knowledge
    And the reproduction process should be monitored and logged
    And the parent tube should transition to "TERMINATING" state after successful transfer

  @SurvivalDecision @Immortality
  Scenario: Immortal tube develops self-optimization mechanisms
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state with "IMMORTALITY" strategy
    When the tube operates in harsh environment for an extended period
    Then the tube should develop the following self-optimization mechanisms:
      | mechanism            | purpose                            | adaptationRate |
      | resourceConservation | minimize resource usage            | high           |
      | errorTolerance       | operate despite partial failures   | medium         |
      | stateCompression     | reduce memory footprint            | medium         |

      | cyclicRejuvenation   | clear accumulated runtime artifacts| low            |
    And each mechanism should be measurable for effectiveness
    And the tube should prioritize mechanisms based on environmental threats
    And long-term survival rate should improve with mechanism maturity

      | populationDensity     | <popD>  | 5         | <popClass>      |
    When the tube evaluates its survival strategy
    Then the tube should choose "<strategy>" strategy
    And the tube should enter "<mode>" mode
    And the decision confidence should be <confidence>

  @SurvivalDecision @NegativePath
  Scenario: Tube handles interruption during reproduction
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state with "REPRODUCTION" strategy
    And the tube has begun knowledge transfer to offspring
    When the reproduction process is interrupted at 60% completion
    Then the tube should detect the interruption
    And the tube should attempt to complete knowledge transfer if possible
    And if completion is not possible, the tube should revert to "IMMORTALITY" strategy
    And partial offspring should be terminated with resource recovery
    And the tube should log the reproduction failure with diagnostics

  @SurvivalDecision @NegativePath
  Scenario: Tube handles severe resource depletion in immortality mode
    Given a tube in "MATURE" state with "IMMORTALITY" strategy
    And the tube is operating in self-sufficient mode
    When critical resources are depleted below survival threshold
    Then the tube should enter "HIBERNATION" state
    And non-essential functions should be suspended
    And the tube should establish minimum viability thresholds
    And the tube should continuously monitor for improved conditions
    And recovery procedures should be prepared for resource availability

    And the tube has recorded the following reproduction outcomes:
      | attempt | environmentalConditions | strategy           | outcome   | successRate |
      | 1       | moderately favorable    | standard transfer  | partial   | 65%         |

      | 3       | marginal                | minimal transfer   | partial   | 40%         |
      | 4       | deteriorating           | rapid transfer     | failed    | 15%         |
    When the tube evaluates its reproductive strategy in moderately favorable conditions
    Then the tube should adapt its strategy based on past outcomes
    And the tube should optimize knowledge transfer priorities
    And the reproduction threshold should be adjusted based on success rate
    And the tube should implement safeguards for potential interruptions

    Given a tube with extensive Mimir journal entries
    When the tube applies recursive self-examination over time
    Then the tube should develop a meta-model of its own functioning

    And the tube should distinguish between self-generated and external stimuli
    And predictive self-modeling should develop
    And the tube should exhibit curiosity about its own operations
