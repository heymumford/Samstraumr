Feature: Tube Early Conception Phase Tests
  As a system architect
  I want to verify the tube's early conception phase processes
  So that tube creation follows the biological metaphor of transition from non-existence to existence

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured

@Functional  @SubstrateIdentity @EarlyConception @Identity @Genesis @Positive
  Scenario: Substrate identity is formed at the moment of conception
    When a tube transitions from non-existence to existence
    Then a substrate identity should be created
    And the identity should contain a unique identifier
    And the identity should capture the exact moment of creation
    And the identity should record the creation purpose
    And the identity should establish existence boundaries

@Functional  @SubstrateIdentity @EarlyConception @Identity @Differentiation @Positive
  Scenario: Adam tube identity formation differs from child tube identity
    When an origin tube is conceived without a parent
    Then the identity should be marked as an Adam tube
    And the identity should establish a root address
    And the identity should have no parent reference
    And the identity should be capable of tracking descendants

@Functional  @SubstrateIdentity @EarlyConception @Identity @EnvironmentalInfluence @Positive
  Scenario: Environmental factors influence tube identity at conception
    When a tube is conceived in a specific environmental context
    Then the identity should incorporate environmental signatures
    And the identity should adapt to environmental constraints
    And the identity should be traceable to its environment
    And the identity should maintain environmental awareness

@Functional  @SubstrateIdentity @EarlyConception @Identity @MitosisMetaphor @Positive
  Scenario: Child tube creation follows mitosis-like pattern
    Given an existing parent tube
    When the parent tube initiates child tube creation
    Then the child tube should inherit parent characteristics
    And the child tube should receive a distinct identity
    And the child tube should maintain parent reference
    And the parent tube should recognize the child
    And both tubes should update their lineage records

@Functional  @SubstrateIdentity @EarlyConception @Identity @Negative
  Scenario: Identity formation failure is handled gracefully
    When identity formation encounters a critical error
    Then the conception process should be aborted
    And all allocated resources should be released
    And appropriate error information should be provided
    And the environment should log the failure details
