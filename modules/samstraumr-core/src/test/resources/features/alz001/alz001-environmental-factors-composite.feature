@ALZ001 @EnvironmentalFactors @L1_Composite
Feature: Environmental Factors Composite for Alzheimer's Disease Modeling
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to model environmental influences on disease progression at the population level
  So that I can analyze intervention strategies and risk factors across patient cohorts

  Background:
    Given an environmental factors modeling environment is initialized
    And the simulation timeframe is set to 5 "years"

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Create and initialize the environmental factors composite
    When I create a new environmental factors composite
    Then the composite should be successfully created
    And the composite should have the correct component type "ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS"
    And the composite should be in an initialized state

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Add and connect environmental factors components
    Given an initialized environmental factors composite
    When I add the following environmental components:
      | component_name | factor_focus           | configuration                      |
      | DietComp       | diet_quality           | diet_impact_factor:1.2             |
      | ExerciseComp   | physical_activity      | stress_impact_factor:0.8           |
      | StressComp     | stress_level           | default_oxidative_stress_baseline:5.0  |
    Then all components should be successfully added
    And I can establish data flow connections between components
    And the composite should coordinate component interactions

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Create and manage patient cohorts with environmental profiles
    Given an environmental factors composite with components
    When I create the following patient cohorts:
      | cohort_name     | description                               | size |
      | control_group   | Participants with no intervention         | 30   |
      | treatment_group | Participants receiving intervention       | 30   |
      | high_risk_group | Participants with high environmental risk | 20   |
    Then all cohorts should be successfully created
    And each cohort should have the specified number of participants
    And each participant should have an environmental profile
    And participant factors should follow expected distributions

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Create and apply intervention programs to patient cohorts
    Given an environmental factors composite with patient cohorts
    When I create the following intervention programs:
      | program_name           | description                             | adherence | dropout | duration |
      | diet_program           | Mediterranean diet intervention         | 0.75      | 0.15    | 180      |
      | exercise_program       | Moderate exercise intervention          | 0.65      | 0.25    | 180      |
      | comprehensive_program  | Combined lifestyle intervention program | 0.60      | 0.20    | 180      |
    And I set the following factor targets for the "comprehensive_program":
      | factor_name         | target_value |
      | physical_activity   | 0.8          |
      | diet_quality        | 0.8          |
      | stress_level        | 0.3          |
      | sleep_quality       | 0.7          |
    And I apply the "comprehensive_program" to the "treatment_group" cohort
    Then all intervention programs should be successfully created
    And the intervention should be applied to all participants in the cohort
    And each participant should have appropriate intervention events

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Perform risk stratification analysis on patient cohorts
    Given an environmental factors composite with diverse patient cohorts
    When I perform risk stratification analysis on all cohorts
    Then each cohort should have risk scores for all participants
    And participants should be classified into low, medium, and high risk strata
    And risk strata should correlate with environmental factors
    And the analysis should identify key risk factors

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze correlations between environmental factors and biomarkers
    Given an environmental factors composite with patient data
    And biomarker measurements for all participants
    When I analyze correlations between environmental factors and biomarker levels
    Then the analysis should identify significant correlations
    And physical activity should show negative correlation with biomarker levels
    And stress levels should show positive correlation with biomarker levels
    And the correlation strengths should be reported with significance levels

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate and compare intervention impacts across cohorts
    Given an environmental factors composite with high-risk patients
    When I simulate the following intervention scenarios:
      | scenario_name      | program_name          | cohort_name    | baseline_risk | timepoints |
      | no_intervention    | baseline              | high_risk_group | 70.0         | 100        |
      | diet_only          | diet_program          | high_risk_group | 70.0         | 100        |
      | exercise_only      | exercise_program      | high_risk_group | 70.0         | 100        |
      | comprehensive      | comprehensive_program | high_risk_group | 70.0         | 100        |
    Then all scenarios should be successfully simulated
    And the comprehensive intervention should show the largest risk reduction
    And intervention effectiveness should vary by initial risk level
    And simulation results should include risk trajectories for all scenarios

  @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle patients with poor intervention adherence
    Given an environmental factors composite with patient cohorts
    When I create an intervention program with low adherence:
      | program_name    | description              | adherence | dropout | duration |
      | low_adherence   | Poor compliance program  | 0.30      | 0.50    | 180      |
    And I apply the program to a cohort
    And I simulate its impact over time
    Then the simulation should model variable adherence effects
    And risk reduction should be less than with high-adherence programs
    And the simulation should identify patients who abandoned the intervention

  @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle missing or incomplete patient environmental data
    Given an environmental factors composite with some incomplete patient profiles
    When I perform analysis on the patient data
    Then the system should identify patients with incomplete data
    And the analysis should apply appropriate handling for missing data
    And confidence intervals should be wider for patients with incomplete data
