@ALZ001 @TimeSeriesAnalysis @L1_Composite
Feature: Time Series Analysis Composite for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to analyze temporal patterns across multiple time series datasets
  So that I can identify disease progression trajectories and biomarker relationships

  Background:
    Given a time series analysis environment is initialized
    And the time series composite is configured with default settings

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Create and initialize the time series analysis composite
    When I create a new time series analysis composite
    Then the composite should be successfully created
    And the composite should have the correct component type
    And the composite should be in an initialized state

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Add and connect time series analysis components
    Given an initialized time series analysis composite
    When I add the following time series components:
      | component_name | component_type           | configuration                    |
      | BiomarkerComp  | TimeSeriesAnalysisComponent | window_size:20, seasonality_periods:12 |
      | ClinicalComp   | TimeSeriesAnalysisComponent | window_size:30, seasonality_periods:6  |
      | AmyloidSeries  | BiomarkerTimeSeries     | biomarker:amyloid_beta, stages:5       |
    Then all components should be successfully added
    And I can establish data flow connections between components
    And the composite should coordinate component interactions

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Create and analyze biomarker datasets
    Given a time series composite with analysis components
    When I create a dataset with the following biomarkers:
      | biomarker_name      | stages | samples_per_stage |
      | amyloid_beta        | 5      | 20                |
      | tau                 | 5      | 20                |
      | phosphorylated_tau  | 5      | 20                |
      | cognitive_score     | 5      | 20                |
    Then the dataset should be successfully created
    And the composite should detect correlations between biomarkers
    And the composite should identify temporal patterns in the dataset
    And the composite should calculate biomarker progression trajectories

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Detect early disease signatures from biomarker data
    Given a time series composite with longitudinal biomarker data
    When I request early disease signature detection
    Then the composite should identify potential early signatures
    And each signature should include associated biomarkers
    And each signature should have a confidence level
    And the signatures should include temporal relationships between biomarkers

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Generate and evaluate biomarker forecasts
    Given a time series composite with biomarker history
    When I generate forecasts with the following parameters:
      | biomarker        | horizon | method                |
      | amyloid_beta     | 12      | exponential_smoothing |
      | tau              | 12      | exponential_smoothing |
      | cognitive_score  | 12      | exponential_smoothing |
    Then the composite should produce point forecasts for each biomarker
    And the forecasts should include prediction intervals
    And the forecast trends should be consistent with disease progression models

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze cross-subject biomarker trajectories
    Given a time series composite with data from multiple subjects
    When I analyze trajectory variability across subjects
    Then the composite should calculate reference trajectories
    And the composite should identify outlier trajectories
    And the composite should quantify subject-to-subject variability
    And the composite should detect trajectory clusters if present

  @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle missing and irregular biomarker data
    Given a time series composite with incomplete data
    When I analyze a dataset with the following characteristics:
      | characteristic          | value       |
      | missing_data_percentage | 15          |
      | irregular_intervals     | true        |
      | outlier_percentage      | 5           |
    Then the composite should detect data irregularities
    And the composite should apply appropriate imputation methods
    And the analysis should include uncertainty estimates
    And the composite should adjust confidence levels based on data quality

  @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Detect concept drift in longitudinal data
    Given a time series composite with longitudinal monitoring data
    When biomarker patterns change over time with the following characteristics:
      | drift_type         | affected_biomarker | onset_time | magnitude |
      | gradual_trend      | tau                | 50         | 0.3       |
      | sudden_mean_shift  | amyloid_beta       | 75         | 0.5       |
    Then the composite should detect the concept drift
    And the composite should identify the affected biomarkers
    And the composite should report drift characteristics
    And the composite should adapt analysis parameters accordingly
