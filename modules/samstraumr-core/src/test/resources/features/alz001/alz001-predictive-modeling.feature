Feature: Predictive Modeling for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to build predictive models for disease progression and treatment response
  So that I can identify early warning signs and personalize interventions

  Background:
    Given a predictive modeling environment is initialized
    And the model training parameters are configured

  @L0_Component @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize predictive modeling component
    When I create a new predictive modeling component
    Then the component should be successfully created
    And the component should have default modeling parameters
    And the component should be in an initialized state

  @L0_Component @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Configure model hyperparameters
    When I create a new predictive modeling component
    And I configure the following model hyperparameters:
      | parameter       | value     |
      | learningRate    | 0.001     |
      | epochs          | 100       |
      | batchSize       | 32        |
      | regularization  | 0.0001    |
      | hiddenLayers    | 3         |
      | dropout         | 0.2       |
    Then the component should have the configured hyperparameters
    And the component should be in a configured state

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Load training data for predictive model
    When I create a new predictive modeling component
    And I load the following training data:
      | patientId | age | apoe | amyloid | tau  | cognition | progression |
      | P001      | 65  | e4/e4| 45.2    | 32.1 | 26        | 3.2         |
      | P002      | 72  | e3/e4| 52.7    | 37.5 | 23        | 4.1         |
      | P003      | 68  | e3/e3| 38.4    | 28.7 | 28        | 2.3         |
      | P004      | 75  | e4/e4| 58.9    | 42.3 | 21        | 4.7         |
      | P005      | 70  | e3/e3| 40.1    | 30.2 | 27        | 2.8         |
    Then the training data should be loaded with 5 samples
    And the component should be in a data loaded state

  @L1_Composite @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Create multi-model prediction composite
    When I create a predictive model named "progression"
    And I create a predictive model named "cognitive"
    And I create a predictive model named "biomarker"
    And I create a predictive modeling composite from models "progression", "cognitive", and "biomarker"
    Then the composite should contain 3 models
    And the composite should be in an initialized state

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Train models and evaluate accuracy
    When I create a predictive model named "mlp"
    And I load training data for model "mlp"
    And I train the model with 5-fold cross-validation
    Then the model should achieve at least 70% prediction accuracy
    And the model should produce meaningful feature importance metrics
    And the model should be in a trained state

  @L2_Machine @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize ensemble prediction machine
    When I create a prediction ensemble machine
    And I add multiple model types to the ensemble:
      | modelType     | parameters                                  |
      | neuralNetwork | {learningRate: 0.001, hiddenLayers: 3}      |
      | randomForest  | {trees: 100, maxDepth: 10}                  |
      | xgboost       | {learningRate: 0.1, maxDepth: 6, trees: 50} |
    Then the ensemble machine should contain 3 model types
    And the ensemble machine should be in a configured state

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Generate personalized prediction with confidence intervals
    When I create a prediction ensemble machine
    And I configure the ensemble for progression prediction
    And I load patient data for prediction:
      | patientId | age | apoe | amyloid | tau  | cognition | diet          | exercise  | medication    |
      | P010      | 69  | e3/e4| 43.5    | 31.2 | 25        | Mediterranean | Moderate  | Cholinesterase|
    When I generate a 5-year progression prediction
    Then the prediction should include a baseline trajectory
    And the prediction should include upper and lower confidence bounds
    And the prediction should identify critical threshold crossing points
    And the model should calculate prediction confidence statistics

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Compare multiple intervention strategies using predictive models
    When I create a treatment optimization machine
    And I load a trained disease progression model
    And I define multiple intervention strategies:
      | strategy      | diet          | exercise  | medication       | cognitiveTraining |
      | conservative  | Mediterranean | Moderate  | Cholinesterase   | Weekly            |
      | moderate      | Mediterranean | High      | Cholinesterase   | Daily             |
      | aggressive    | Mediterranean | High      | Combined         | Daily             |
    When I simulate outcomes for patient profile:
      | age | apoe | amyloid | tau  | cognition | comorbidities |
      | 71  | e4/e4| 48.2    | 35.3 | 24        | Hypertension  |
    Then the simulation should rank strategies by effectiveness
    And the simulation should provide personalized risk-benefit analysis
    And the simulation should identify the optimal intervention timing

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Integrate predictive models into comprehensive clinical decision support
    Given I have a complete disease modeling system
    When I integrate predictive models into the clinical workflow
    And I load a patient case for comprehensive analysis:
      | patientId | age | gender | apoe | familyHistory | biomarkers | imaging | cognitive | environmental |
      | P020      | 67  | Female | e3/e4| Positive      | Complete   | MRI+PET | Complete  | Complete      |
    Then the system should generate a comprehensive disease risk profile
    And the system should identify personalized intervention priorities
    And the system should predict treatment response probabilities
    And the system should generate a clinical decision support report

  # Negative test cases

  @L0_Component @Infancy @Negative
  Scenario: Handle invalid hyperparameters
    When I create a new predictive modeling component
    And I attempt to configure the following invalid hyperparameters:
      | parameter       | value     |
      | learningRate    | -0.1      |
      | epochs          | -50       |
      | batchSize       | 0         |
      | regularization  | -0.5      |
    Then the component should reject the invalid hyperparameters
    And the component should report specific validation errors for each parameter
    And the component should maintain its default configuration

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle insufficient training data
    When I create a new predictive modeling component
    And I attempt to load insufficient training data with only 2 samples
    Then the component should detect the insufficient data condition
    And the component should generate an appropriate warning
    And the component should not transition to the training-ready state

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle models with incompatible data schemas
    When I create a predictive model named "genetic" with gene expression schema
    And I create a predictive model named "imaging" with MRI volumetric schema
    And I attempt to create a composite with incompatible models
    Then the operation should fail with a schema compatibility error
    And the system should suggest data transformation steps to resolve the issue

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle prediction requests with missing critical data
    When I create a prediction ensemble machine
    And I configure the ensemble for progression prediction
    And I attempt to generate a prediction with incomplete patient data:
      | patientId | age | apoe | cognition |
      | P010      | 69  | e3/e4| 25        |
    Then the machine should identify the missing critical features
    And the machine should provide a confidence-adjusted prediction
    And the machine should flag the prediction as requiring additional data

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle conflicting intervention strategies
    When I create a treatment optimization machine
    And I load a trained disease progression model
    And I define conflicting intervention strategies:
      | strategy      | diet          | exercise  | medication             |
      | conflicting1  | Mediterranean | High      | ContraindicatedWithHigh |
      | conflicting2  | DASH          | None      | RequiresExercise        |
    Then the machine should detect the intervention conflicts
    And the machine should generate conflict resolution recommendations
    And the machine should rank non-conflicting elements separately

  @L3_System @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle prediction inconsistencies across multiple models
    Given I have a complete disease modeling system
    When I integrate multiple models with contradictory predictions
    And I load a complex patient case for analysis
    Then the system should detect prediction inconsistencies
    And the system should apply ensemble reconciliation methods
    And the system should report uncertainty metrics for contradictory predictions
    And the system should suggest additional data collection to resolve ambiguities
