Feature: Advanced System Orchestration for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As a systems neuroscience researcher
  I want to orchestrate multiple specialized modeling machines in a coordinated system
  So that I can conduct comprehensive cross-scale analysis of Alzheimer's disease mechanisms

  Background:
    Given a comprehensive Alzheimer's disease modeling environment
    And all five composite subsystems are available for integration
    And specialized machine configurations have been prepared

  @L3_System @Orchestration @Positive
  Scenario: Create multi-machine orchestration system with specialized domains
    When I create a system orchestrator with the following specialized machines:
      | machine_type            | purpose                           |
      | protein_aggregation     | molecular pathology modeling      |
      | network_connectivity    | neural connectivity degradation   |
      | temporal_progression    | disease stage transition analysis |
      | environmental_factors   | modifiable risk factor analysis   |
      | predictive_modeling     | personalized intervention design  |
    Then the orchestrator should initialize all machines
    And the orchestrator should establish cross-machine communication channels
    And the orchestrator should register all machine capabilities

  @L3_System @Orchestration @Positive
  Scenario: Configure cross-machine data exchange protocols
    Given a system orchestrator with multiple specialized machines
    When I establish the following cross-machine data exchange protocols:
      | source_machine        | target_machine        | data_type                   | validation_level |
      | protein_aggregation   | network_connectivity  | aggregation_pathology_data  | strict           |
      | network_connectivity  | temporal_progression  | connectivity_metrics        | normal           |
      | temporal_progression  | predictive_modeling   | disease_stage_transitions   | strict           |
      | environmental_factors | protein_aggregation   | environmental_influences    | normal           |
      | environmental_factors | predictive_modeling   | modifiable_risk_profiles    | normal           |
    Then the orchestrator should validate all cross-machine data schemas
    And the orchestrator should establish secure data transformation pipelines

  @L3_System @Orchestration @Positive
  Scenario: Load comprehensive multi-modal datasets across specialized machines
    Given a system orchestrator with configured data exchange protocols
    When I load the following multi-modal datasets:
      | dataset_name          | data_types                                      | patients | timepoints |
      | ADNI_comprehensive    | imaging,biomarker,cognitive,genetic             | 800      | 6          |
      | AIBL_longitudinal     | imaging,biomarker,cognitive                     | 400      | 4          |
      | PREVENT_AD            | genetic,environmental,biomarker                 | 600      | 5          |
      | UK_Biobank_subset     | environmental,lifestyle,cognitive,comorbidities | 2000     | 3          |
    Then each machine should receive its relevant data subset
    And the orchestrator should verify data consistency across machines
    And the orchestrator should build integrated patient profiles

  @L3_System @Orchestration @Positive
  Scenario: Execute coordinated multi-machine simulation
    Given a system orchestrator with loaded datasets
    When I set the following orchestration parameters:
      | parameter                      | value                |
      | execution_strategy             | staged_parallel      |
      | synchronization_points         | 4                    |
      | cross_validation_level         | high                 |
      | result_integration_method      | hierarchical_bayesian|
      | uncertainty_propagation        | enabled              |
    And I execute a coordinated multi-machine simulation
    Then all machines should complete their specialized simulations
    And all cross-machine data transfers should succeed
    And the orchestrator should generate an integrated simulation report

  @L3_System @Analysis @Positive
  Scenario: Perform cross-scale multi-mechanism analysis
    Given a system orchestrator with completed simulation results
    When I request the following cross-scale analyses:
      | analysis_type               | scale_combinations                      | statistical_method           |
      | causal_pathway_analysis     | molecular-cellular-network              | structural_equation_modeling |
      | temporal_ordering           | all_scales                              | event_sequence_analysis      |
      | moderation_mediation        | environmental-molecular-network         | bayesian_mediation_analysis  |
      | vulnerability_identification| network-cognitive-clinical              | machine_learning_ensemble    |
      | compensatory_mechanisms     | cellular-network-cognitive              | resilience_pathway_analysis  |
    Then the orchestrator should successfully complete all analyses
    And the analysis should identify multi-scale interaction patterns
    And the analysis should quantify relative contributions of different mechanisms
    And the analysis should detect emergent disease properties

  @L3_System @ClinicalTranslation @Positive
  Scenario: Generate clinically actionable insights and recommendations
    Given a system orchestrator with comprehensive analysis results
    When I request translation of system analyses into clinical applications:
      | application_area            | target_audience        | implementation_timeframe |
      | diagnostic_biomarkers       | clinicians             | near_term                |
      | disease_subtyping           | clinical_researchers   | near_term                |
      | progression_prediction      | clinicians             | medium_term              |
      | intervention_targeting      | drug_developers        | medium_term              |
      | prevention_strategies       | public_health          | long_term                |
    Then the orchestrator should generate specific clinical recommendations
    And all recommendations should include supporting evidence levels
    And all recommendations should include implementation requirements
    And all recommendations should include uncertainty quantification

  @L3_System @Resilience @Negative
  Scenario: Test orchestration system resilience to machine failures
    Given a system orchestrator with multiple specialized machines
    When I simulate the following machine failures during operation:
      | failing_machine      | failure_type           | failure_timing        |
      | protein_aggregation  | data_corruption        | during_simulation     |
      | network_connectivity | resource_exhaustion    | during_data_exchange  |
      | temporal_progression | service_unavailable    | during_analysis       |
    Then the orchestrator should detect all machine failures
    And the orchestrator should implement appropriate failure recovery mechanisms
    And the orchestrator should adjust results to account for reduced reliability
    And the orchestrator should complete orchestration with degraded but valid results

  @L3_System @Verification @Positive
  Scenario: Validate system orchestration results against external benchmarks
    Given a system orchestrator with integrated simulation results
    When I validate the orchestrated system against the following benchmarks:
      | benchmark_type                   | external_dataset      | comparison_metrics                            |
      | disease_progression_accuracy     | NACC_longitudinal     | prediction_error,stage_accuracy               |
      | biomarker_trajectory_fidelity    | BioFINDER            | correlation,transition_point_identification   |
      | intervention_response_prediction | FINGER_intervention   | effect_size_prediction,response_stratification|
      | risk_prediction_performance      | Rotterdam_study       | AUC,calibration,net_reclassification         |
    Then the orchestrated system should meet minimum performance thresholds for all benchmarks
    And the orchestrated system should outperform single-machine systems on integrated tasks
    And the system should demonstrate consistent performance across diverse populations
