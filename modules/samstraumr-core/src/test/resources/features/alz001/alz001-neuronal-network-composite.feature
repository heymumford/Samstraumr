@ALZ001 @Composite
Feature: Neuronal Network Composite for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to model neuronal networks and their degeneration patterns
  So that I can analyze structural and functional brain changes in disease progression

  Background:
    Given an ALZ001 test environment is initialized

  @L1_Composite @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize a neuronal network composite with basic configuration
    When I create a neuronal network composite named "BasicNeuronalNetwork"
    And I configure the following properties for the composite:
      | signal_propagation_decay    | 0.1   |
      | compensation_enabled        | true  |
      | initialize_default_network  | false |
      | include_functional_networks | false |
    And I initialize the composite
    Then the composite should be successfully initialized
    And the composite type should be "NEURONAL_NETWORK"
    And the composite state should be "READY"

  @L1_Composite @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Create a default brain network with multiple regions
    When I create a neuronal network composite named "DefaultBrainNetwork"
    And I configure the following properties for the composite:
      | signal_propagation_decay    | 0.1   |
      | compensation_enabled        | true  |
      | initialize_default_network  | true  |
      | include_functional_networks | true  |
    And I initialize the composite
    Then the composite should be successfully initialized
    And the composite should contain at least 5 brain regions
    And the composite should contain at least 5 region connections
    And the composite should contain at least 3 functional networks

  @L1_Composite @Childhood @Positive
  Scenario: Create custom brain regions with different network topologies
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite named "CustomBrainNetwork"
    When I create the following brain regions:
      | name              | function             | topology     |
      | hippocampus       | memory_formation     | small-world  |
      | prefrontal_cortex | executive_function   | scale-free   |
      | parietal_lobe     | sensory_integration  | random       |
    And I establish the following region connections:
      | source            | target            | type       | strength |
      | hippocampus       | prefrontal_cortex | structural | 0.8      |
      | prefrontal_cortex | parietal_lobe     | structural | 0.6      |
      | hippocampus       | parietal_lobe     | functional | 0.4      |
    Then the composite should contain 3 brain regions
    And the composite should contain 3 region connections
    And the "hippocampus" region should have "small-world" topology
    And the "prefrontal_cortex" region should have "scale-free" topology

  @L1_Composite @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Create custom functional networks spanning multiple regions
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with the following regions:
      | name              | function             | topology     |
      | hippocampus       | memory_formation     | small-world  |
      | prefrontal_cortex | executive_function   | small-world  |
      | temporal_lobe     | language_processing  | small-world  |
      | parietal_lobe     | sensory_integration  | small-world  |
    And I have established connectivity between the regions
    When I create the following functional networks:
      | name             | function           | regions                              |
      | memory_network   | memory_processing  | hippocampus,prefrontal_cortex        |
      | language_network | language_processing| temporal_lobe,prefrontal_cortex      |
      | attention_network| attention_control  | prefrontal_cortex,parietal_lobe      |
    Then the composite should contain 3 functional networks
    And the "memory_network" should include the "hippocampus" region
    And the "language_network" should include the "temporal_lobe" region
    And the "attention_network" should include the "parietal_lobe" region
    And all functional networks should include the "prefrontal_cortex" region

  @L1_Composite @Childhood @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate signal propagation across brain regions
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with default brain network
    When I simulate signal propagation starting from the "prefrontal_cortex" region with strength 0.9
    Then the signal should propagate to at least 3 regions
    And the "hippocampus" region should receive a signal strength of at least 0.5
    And the signal strength should decrease with network distance

  @L1_Composite @Adolescence @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate neuronal network degeneration with regional vulnerability
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with default brain network
    When I simulate regional degeneration with rate 0.05 over 10 time points
    Then regions with higher vulnerability should show greater connectivity loss
    And the "hippocampus" region should show greater degeneration than "parietal_lobe"
    And all regions should show progressive connectivity decline over time

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze global network measures
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with default brain network
    When I calculate global network measures
    Then the global connectivity measure should be between 0 and 1
    And the global clustering coefficient should be between 0 and 1
    And the region connection integrity should be between 0 and 1

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze functional network integrity
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with default brain network and functional networks
    When I analyze functional network integrity
    Then all functional networks should have integrity measures between 0 and 1
    And the "memory_network" integrity should be at least 0.7

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate protein impact on network degeneration
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with default brain network
    When I simulate the impact of the following protein levels on the network:
      | protein            | level |
      | amyloid            | 80    |
      | tau                | 60    |
      | phosphorylated_tau | 40    |
    Then all regions should show connectivity decline over time
    And regions with higher vulnerability should show greater impact from protein levels

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate compensatory network reorganization
    Given I have created a neuronal network composite with default brain network
    When I simulate network damage to the following regions:
      | region            |
      | hippocampus       |
      | entorhinal_cortex |
    And I simulate compensatory reorganization with factor 0.3 over 10 time points
    Then undamaged regions should show increased connectivity over time
    And global network measures should initially decrease then partially recover
