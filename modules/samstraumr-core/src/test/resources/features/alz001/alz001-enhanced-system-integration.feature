Feature: Enhanced System Integration for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want a fully integrated multi-scale modeling system combining all five composite components
  So that I can analyze comprehensive disease mechanisms and develop targeted interventions

  Background:
    Given a comprehensive Alzheimer's disease modeling environment
    And all five composite subsystems are available for integration

  @L3_System @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize enhanced integrated Alzheimer's disease modeling system
    When I create a new integrated disease modeling system
    And I configure the following data validation rules for the integrated system:
      | data_type            | validation_rule                                     |
      | protein_measurements | range:0-100, units:ng/ml, max_missing:0.1           |
      | network_metrics      | connectivity:0.0-1.0, centrality:0-10, sparsity:>0  |
      | time_series          | min_length:10, max_gaps:3, periodicity:allowed      |
      | environmental_data   | categorical:validated, temporal:continuous          |
      | clinical_outcomes    | scales:standardized, assessor:blinded               |
    And I establish the following data flow paths between composites:
      | source_component         | target_component         | data_type           | refresh_rate |
      | ProteinExpressionModule  | NeuronalNetworkModule    | protein_levels      | 1h           |
      | NeuronalNetworkModule    | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule | network_metrics     | 1h           |
      | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule | PredictiveModelingModule | temporal_patterns   | 1d           |
      | EnvironmentalFactorsModule | PredictiveModelingModule | factor_effects    | 1d           |
    Then the system components should communicate through proper channel establishment

  Scenario: Configure and execute enhanced disease modeling simulation
    Given I create a new integrated disease modeling system
    When I load the following patient datasets into the integrated system:
      | dataset_name       | patients | timepoints | features | format   |
      | ADNI               | 500      | 10         | 50       | tabular  |
      | DIAN               | 300      | 8          | 40       | tabular  |
      | UK Biobank         | 1000     | 5          | 30       | tabular  |
    And I configure the following parameters for the integrated simulation:
      | parameter                   | value                |
      | temporal_resolution         | 1 month              |
      | simulation_duration         | 5 years              |
      | random_seed                 | 12345                |
      | stochasticity_level         | medium               |
      | intervention_enabled        | true                 |
    And I execute a full integrated disease modeling simulation
    Then the integrated system should generate comprehensive disease trajectories
    And the results from each composite should contribute to the unified model

      | network-cognitive             | structural_equation    | 0.05                   |
      | environmental-molecular       | mixed_effects_model    | 0.05                   |
    Then the integrated system should identify significant relationships between:
      | scale1         | scale2         | expected_pattern                   |
      | molecular      | cellular       | protein cascade triggers response  |
      | cellular       | network        | cell changes alter connectivity    |
      | network        | cognitive      | network disruption affects function|
      | environmental  | molecular      | environment modulates expression   |

    When I request personalized treatment recommendations for patient groups:
      | patient_group | age_range | genetic_risk | biomarker_profile  | cognitive_status  |
      | early_onset   | 45-60     | high         | amyloid+/tau+      | MCI               |
      | late_onset    | 70-85     | medium       | amyloid+/tau+      | mild_dementia     |
      | preclinical   | 60-75     | high         | amyloid+/tau-      | normal            |
    Then the integrated system should provide personalized intervention plans

      | mechanism_focus           | molecular,network,environmental         |
    Then the integrated system should generate at least 5 testable hypotheses

      | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule   | measurement_noise  | 25%                 |
      | EnvironmentalFactorsModule | inconsistent_units | 10%                 |
    Then the integrated system should recover from data quality issues with at least 0.75 accuracy

    And the model should identify subgroups where personalization would be most effective
