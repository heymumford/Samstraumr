Feature: System Integration for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to integrate multiple modeling components into a comprehensive system
  So that I can analyze complex disease mechanisms and develop personalized interventions

  Background:
    Given a system integration environment is initialized
    And all required subsystems are available

  @L3_System @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize comprehensive Alzheimer's disease modeling system
    When I create a new disease modeling system
    And I configure the following system components:
      | component_type           | status   | version |
      | ProteinExpressionModule  | enabled  | 1.0     |
      | NeuronalNetworkModule    | enabled  | 1.0     |
      | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule | enabled  | 1.0     |
      | EnvironmentalFactorsModule | enabled | 1.0    |
      | PredictiveModelingModule | enabled  | 1.0     |
    Then the system should be successfully initialized
    And all components should report ready status
    And the system should establish inter-component communication channels

  @L3_System @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Configure system-wide data sharing and validation
    Given an initialized disease modeling system
    When I configure the following data validation rules:
      | data_type            | validation_rule                                     |
      | protein_measurements | range:0-100, units:ng/ml, max_missing:0.1           |
      | network_metrics      | connectivity:0.0-1.0, centrality:0-10, sparsity:>0  |
      | time_series          | min_length:10, max_gaps:3, periodicity:allowed      |
      | environmental_data   | categorical:validated, temporal:continuous          |
      | clinical_outcomes    | scales:standardized, assessor:blinded               |
    And I establish the following data flow paths:
      | source_component         | target_component         | data_type           | refresh_rate |
      | ProteinExpressionModule  | NeuronalNetworkModule    | protein_levels      | 1h           |
      | NeuronalNetworkModule    | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule | network_metrics     | 1h           |
      | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule | PredictiveModelingModule | temporal_patterns   | 1d           |
      | EnvironmentalFactorsModule | PredictiveModelingModule | factor_effects    | 1d           |
    Then the system should validate all data exchange formats
    And the system should establish secure data transfer between components
    And the system should log all data transformations for reproducibility

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Execute end-to-end Alzheimer's disease simulation
    Given a fully configured disease modeling system
    When I load the following patient cohort data:
      | dataset_name       | patients | timepoints | features | format   |
      | ADNI               | 500      | 10         | 50       | tabular  |
      | DIAN               | 300      | 8          | 40       | tabular  |
      | UK Biobank         | 1000     | 5          | 30       | tabular  |
    And I configure the following simulation parameters:
      | parameter                   | value                |
      | temporal_resolution         | 1 month              |
      | simulation_duration         | 5 years              |
      | random_seed                 | 12345                |
      | stochasticity_level         | medium               |
      | intervention_enabled        | true                 |
    When I execute a full system simulation
    Then the system should generate integrated disease trajectories
    And the system should identify key progression factors
    And the system should calculate intervention efficacy metrics
    And the system should produce visualization-ready outputs

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze multi-scale interactions in disease mechanisms
    Given a disease modeling system with simulation results
    When I analyze cross-scale interactions with the following parameters:
      | scale_pair                    | analysis_method        | significance_threshold |
      | molecular-cellular            | canonical_correlation  | 0.05                   |
      | cellular-network              | mediation_analysis     | 0.05                   |
      | network-cognitive             | structural_equation    | 0.05                   |
      | environmental-molecular       | mixed_effects_model    | 0.05                   |
    Then the system should identify significant cross-scale relationships
    And the system should quantify causal pathway strengths
    And the system should detect emergent system behaviors
    And the system should rank mechanistic hypotheses by evidence strength

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Generate personalized treatment recommendations
    Given a disease modeling system with patient data
    When I request treatment optimization for patients with the following characteristics:
      | patient_group | age_range | genetic_risk | biomarker_profile  | cognitive_status  |
      | early_onset   | 45-60     | high         | amyloid+/tau+      | MCI               |
      | late_onset    | 70-85     | medium       | amyloid+/tau+      | mild_dementia     |
      | preclinical   | 60-75     | high         | amyloid+/tau-      | normal            |
    Then the system should generate personalized treatment plans
    And the system should prioritize interventions by predicted efficacy
    And the system should calculate number-needed-to-treat metrics
    And the system should provide precision dosing recommendations
    And the system should estimate cost-effectiveness for each strategy

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Validate system against real-world clinical outcomes
    Given a disease modeling system with historical predictions
    When I load the following validation datasets:
      | dataset_name       | patients | follow_up | outcome_measures                   |
      | Clinical Trial X   | 250      | 18 months | cognition, biomarkers, adverse events |
      | Observational Y    | 500      | 36 months | cognition, function, progression rate |
    And I perform model validation with the following metrics:
      | metric                | threshold |
      | accuracy              | >0.7      |
      | calibration_slope     | 0.9-1.1   |
      | discrimination (AUC)  | >0.8      |
      | net_reclassification  | >0.15     |
    Then the system should correctly predict outcomes for at least 75% of patients
    And the system should properly calibrate risk predictions
    And the system should demonstrate clinical utility through decision curve analysis
    And the system should identify subgroups where model performance can be improved

  @L3_System @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Test system resilience to conflicting or missing data
    Given a disease modeling system with integrated subsystems
    When I introduce the following data quality issues:
      | subsystem                  | issue_type         | affected_percentage |
      | ProteinExpressionModule    | missing_values     | 20%                 |
      | NeuronalNetworkModule      | conflicting_data   | 15%                 |
      | TimeSeriesAnalysisModule   | measurement_noise  | 25%                 |
      | EnvironmentalFactorsModule | inconsistent_units | 10%                 |
    Then the system should detect data quality issues
    And the system should apply appropriate correction strategies
    And the system should quantify uncertainty in outputs
    And the system should gracefully degrade performance rather than fail
    And the system should recommend additional data collection to resolve ambiguities

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Generate research hypotheses from system-level analysis
    Given a disease modeling system with comprehensive simulation results
    When I run hypothesis generation analysis with the following parameters:
      | parameter                 | value                                   |
      | evidence_threshold        | high                                    |
      | novelty_premium           | moderate                                |
      | mechanism_focus           | pathways, networks, environmental       |
      | clinical_relevance_filter | potentially_modifiable                  |
    Then the system should generate testable research hypotheses
    And the system should rank hypotheses by evidence strength and novelty
    And the system should suggest experimental designs to test each hypothesis
    And the system should identify potential therapeutic targets
    And the system should estimate potential clinical impact of findings
