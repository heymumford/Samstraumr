Feature: Protein Expression Component Modeling for Alzheimer's Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to model protein expression patterns related to the disease
  So that I can analyze relationships between protein markers and disease progression

  Background:
    Given a protein expression modeling environment is initialized
    And the simulation timestep is set to 100 milliseconds

  @L0_Component @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize protein expression component
    When I create a new protein expression component
    Then the component should be successfully created
    And the component should have default protein expression thresholds
    And the component should be in an initialized state

  @L0_Component @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Load and validate protein expression data
    Given an initialized protein expression component
    When I load a dataset with the following protein types:
      | protein_type | measurement_unit | normal_range_min | normal_range_max |
      | Tau          | ng/ml           | 80               | 150              |
      | Amyloid-beta | pg/ml           | 500              | 1200             |
      | APOE         | mg/dl           | 30               | 45               |
    Then the data should be successfully loaded
    And the component should report data statistics for each protein type

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze protein expression patterns over time
    Given an initialized protein expression component with loaded baseline data
    When I process a time series of protein measurements with 50 data points
    Then the component should identify temporal patterns in the data
    And the component should calculate rate of change for each protein type
    And the component should detect expression pattern anomalies

  @L1_Composite @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Create and connect protein expression composite
    Given an initialized protein expression component
    When I create a protein expression composite with the following sub-components:
      | component_type               | configuration                     |
      | Tau Aggregation Analyzer     | threshold:120, window_size:5      |
      | Amyloid Deposition Monitor   | threshold:800, sensitivity:high   |
      | Inflammatory Marker Tracker  | baseline:10, alert_threshold:30   |
    Then the composite should be successfully created
    And all sub-components should be properly connected
    And the composite should expose a unified protein expression interface

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Detect protein expression correlation patterns
    Given a protein expression composite with historical data
    When I analyze cross-correlations between protein markers
    Then the system should identify statistically significant correlations
    And the system should generate correlation strength metrics
    And the system should detect time-lagged relationships between markers

  @L2_Machine @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Configure and validate protein expression machine
    Given a protein expression composite
    When I create a protein expression machine with the following configuration:
      | setting                    | value                           |
      | analysis_interval          | 500                             |
      | statistical_confidence     | 0.95                            |
      | anomaly_detection_method   | isolation_forest                |
      | pattern_detection_algorithm| dynamic_time_warping            |
    Then the machine should be successfully configured
    And the machine should validate the configuration parameters
    And the machine should initialize all required processing engines

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Process multiple protein datasets in parallel
    Given a configured protein expression machine
    When I submit 3 different protein expression datasets for parallel processing
    And I configure the following analysis types:
      | analysis_type          | parameters                                       |
      | cluster_analysis       | method:kmeans, clusters:3, iterations:100        |
      | outlier_detection      | method:zscore, threshold:3.0                     |
      | pattern_recognition    | method:sequential, min_support:0.6, window:10    |
    Then all datasets should be processed concurrently
    And the machine should generate independent analysis results for each dataset
    And the machine should maintain data isolation between analyses
    And the results should include expected statistical metrics

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Integrate protein expression with other biological subsystems
    Given a protein expression machine with processed data
    And a neuronal network machine with connectivity data
    When I connect these machines in a biological system composite
    Then the system should establish correct data flow between the machines
    And the system should correlate protein expression with network degradation
    And the system should generate integrated biomarker reports

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Validate handling of inconsistent protein measurement units
    Given an initialized protein expression component
    When I try to load protein data with inconsistent measurement units:
      | protein_type | value | unit  |
      | Tau          | 120   | ng/ml |
      | Tau          | 0.12  | Âµg/ml |
    Then the component should detect the unit inconsistency
    And the component should attempt unit conversion
    And the component should generate appropriate warnings

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Test resilience to corrupted protein expression data
    Given a protein expression composite
    When I submit protein data with the following corruption patterns:
      | corruption_type | frequency | magnitude |
      | missing_values  | 0.1       | n/a       |
      | outliers        | 0.05      | 5.0       |
      | noise           | 0.2       | 2.0       |
    Then the composite should detect the corrupted data
    And the composite should apply appropriate data cleaning techniques
    And the composite should report data quality metrics
    And the analysis results should include uncertainty estimates
