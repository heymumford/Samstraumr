Feature: Neuronal Network Structure Modeling for Alzheimer's Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to model neuronal network structures and their degradation patterns
  So that I can analyze relationships between network topology and disease progression

  Background:
    Given a neuronal network modeling environment is initialized
    And the simulation timestep is set to 100 milliseconds

  @L0_Component @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize neuronal network component
    When I create a new neuronal network component
    Then the component should be successfully created
    And the component should have default network parameters
    And the component should be in an initialized state

  @L0_Component @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Create neuronal network with specific topology
    Given an initialized neuronal network component
    When I create a network with the following topology:
      | network_type  | nodes | connections | connection_density |
      | small-world   | 100   | 500        | 0.1                |
    Then the network should be successfully created
    And the network should have 100 nodes
    And the network should have 500 connections
    And the network should have small-world characteristics

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate neuron firing patterns
    Given a neuronal network with small-world topology
    When I stimulate nodes with the following pattern:
      | node_ids | amplitude | duration_ms | frequency_hz |
      | 1,2,3    | 10.0      | 500         | 20           |
      | 50,51,52 | 5.0       | 300         | 10           |
    Then the network should propagate activation signals
    And the activation should follow expected small-world dynamics
    And the component should record firing patterns for all nodes

  @L1_Composite @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Create and connect neuronal network composite
    Given an initialized neuronal network component
    When I create a neuronal network composite with the following sub-components:
      | component_type             | configuration                   |
      | SynapticDensityAnalyzer    | baseline:0.7, threshold:0.5     |
      | NetworkTopologyMonitor     | measure:clustering, interval:10 |
      | NeuronalActivityRecorder   | sampling_rate:25, buffer:1000   |
    Then the composite should be successfully created
    And all sub-components should be properly connected
    And the composite should expose a unified neuronal network interface

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Analyze network resilience metrics
    Given a neuronal network composite with a complex network
    When I analyze network resilience with the following parameters:
      | parameter              | value   |
      | attack_strategy        | targeted|
      | degradation_percentage | 20      |
      | repetitions            | 5       |
    Then the system should calculate resilience metrics
    And the system should identify critical nodes
    And the system should estimate network robustness score

  @L2_Machine @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Configure and validate neuronal network machine
    Given a neuronal network composite
    When I create a neuronal network machine with the following configuration:
      | setting                | value                    |
      | simulation_interval    | 250                      |
      | topology_type          | hierarchical-modular     |
      | plasticity_rule        | spike-timing-dependent   |
      | homeostasis_enabled    | true                     |
    Then the machine should be successfully configured
    And the machine should validate the configuration parameters
    And the machine should initialize all required processing modules

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Simulate network degeneration patterns
    Given a configured neuronal network machine
    When I simulate network degeneration with the following parameters:
      | parameter                   | value                |
      | degeneration_model          | tau-mediated         |
      | target_regions              | hippocampus,cortex   |
      | progression_rate            | 0.05                 |
      | simulation_duration_days    | 365                  |
    Then the machine should simulate progressive network damage
    And the machine should track regional connectivity changes
    And the machine should predict functional impact scores
    And the machine should generate degeneration trajectory plots

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Integrate neuronal network with protein expression data
    Given a neuronal network machine with simulated degeneration
    And a protein expression machine with tau and amyloid data
    When I correlate protein levels with network metrics
    Then the system should establish statistical correlations
    And the system should identify regional vulnerability patterns
    And the system should generate integrated pathology reports

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Validate handling of isolated network components
    Given an initialized neuronal network component
    When I create a network with the following topology:
      | network_type | nodes | connections | connection_density |
      | random       | 100   | 0          | 0.0                |
    Then the component should detect the isolated nodes issue
    And the component should attempt to apply minimum connectivity
    And the component should generate appropriate warnings

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Test resilience to abnormal firing patterns
    Given a neuronal network composite with a healthy network
    When I introduce the following abnormal firing patterns:
      | pattern_type   | affected_nodes | frequency_multiplier | duration_ms |
      | hypersynchrony | 0.3            | 5.0                  | 2000        |
      | silencing      | 0.2            | 0.0                  | 3000        |
    Then the composite should detect the abnormal patterns
    And the composite should attempt to restore network homeostasis
    And the composite should report network health metrics
    And the analysis results should include pathological pattern classifications
