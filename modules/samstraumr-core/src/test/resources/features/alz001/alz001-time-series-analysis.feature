@ALZ001 @TimeSeriesAnalysis
Feature: Time Series Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As an Alzheimer's disease researcher
  I want to analyze temporal patterns in biomarker data
  So that I can identify early disease signatures and progression trajectories

  Background:
    Given a time series analysis environment is initialized
    And the sampling frequency is set to 10 Hz

  @L0_Component @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize time series component
    When I create a new time series analysis component
    Then the component should be successfully created
    And the component should have default analysis parameters
    And the component should be in an initialized state

  @L0_Component @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Load and validate time series data
    Given an initialized time series component
    When I load a dataset with the following time series:
      | series_name    | data_points | start_time | sampling_interval_ms |
      | tau_protein    | 100         | 0          | 100                  |
      | amyloid_beta   | 100         | 0          | 100                  |
      | brain_activity | 100         | 0          | 100                  |
    Then the data should be successfully loaded
    And the component should report basic statistics for each time series
    And the component should verify data integrity

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
    Given a time series component with biomarker data
    When I decompose the time series with the following parameters:
      | parameter           | value       |
      | decomposition_model | stl         |
      | seasonal_period     | 12          |
      | robust              | true        |
    Then the component should extract trend components
    And the component should extract seasonal components
    And the component should extract residual components
    And the decomposition should preserve the original signal

  @L1_Composite @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Create and connect time series composite
    Given an initialized time series component
    When I create a time series composite with the following sub-components:
      | component_type               | configuration                       |
      | AutocorrelationAnalyzer      | max_lag:20, ci_level:0.95           |
      | SpectralDensityEstimator     | method:periodogram, window:hamming  |
      | ChangePointDetector          | algo:cusum, threshold:0.05          |
    Then the composite should be successfully created
    And all sub-components should be properly connected
    And the composite should expose a unified time series interface

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Detect correlation between multiple time series
    Given a time series composite with multiple biomarker data
    When I analyze cross-correlations with the following parameters:
      | parameter              | value         |
      | max_lag                | 15            |
      | significance_level     | 0.05          |
      | adjustment_method      | bonferroni    |
    Then the system should identify significant correlations
    And the system should determine lag relationships
    And the system should quantify correlation strength
    And the system should generate pairwise correlation matrices

  @L2_Machine @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Configure and validate time series analysis machine
    Given a time series composite
    When I create a time series machine with the following configuration:
      | setting                     | value                     |
      | analysis_interval           | 3600                      |
      | detrending_method           | differencing              |
      | missing_value_strategy      | linear_interpolation      |
      | outlier_detection_method    | zscore                    |
    Then the machine should be successfully configured
    And the machine should validate the configuration parameters
    And the machine should initialize all required analysis modules

  @L2_Machine @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Forecast future values from time series data
    Given a configured time series machine with longitudinal data
    When I generate forecasts with the following parameters:
      | parameter                | value              |
      | forecast_model           | arima              |
      | horizon                  | 12                 |
      | confidence_level         | 0.95               |
      | validation_method        | rolling_window     |
      | evaluation_metric        | rmse               |
    Then the machine should generate future point forecasts
    And the machine should calculate prediction intervals
    And the machine should evaluate forecast accuracy
    And the machine should identify forecast uncertainty sources

  @L3_System @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Integrate time series analysis with biomarker and clinical data
    Given a time series machine with longitudinal biomarker data
    And a clinical assessment dataset with cognitive scores
    When I perform integrated temporal analysis
    Then the system should identify temporal relationships between biomarkers and cognition
    And the system should detect early change patterns preceding cognitive decline
    And the system should calculate temporal lag between biomarker changes and symptoms
    And the system should prioritize biomarkers by temporal predictive power

  @L0_Component @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle irregular time series with missing data
    Given an initialized time series component
    When I load an irregular time series with the following characteristics:
      | characteristic          | value       |
      | missing_data_percentage | 15          |
      | irregular_intervals     | true        |
      | outlier_percentage      | 5           |
    Then the component should detect data irregularities
    And the component should apply appropriate imputation methods
    And the component should report data quality metrics
    And the analysis should include uncertainty estimates

  @L1_Composite @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Test resilience to concept drift in longitudinal data
    Given a time series composite with longitudinal data
    When I introduce concept drift with the following characteristics:

      | sudden_mean_shift | amyloid_beta     | 75          | 0.5      |
    Then the composite should detect the concept drift
    And the composite should adapt analysis parameters
