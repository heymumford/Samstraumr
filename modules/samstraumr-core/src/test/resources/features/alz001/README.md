# ALZ001 Test Suite

This directory contains BDD feature files for the ALZ001 initiative, which focuses on modeling Alzheimer's disease using the Samstraumr framework. These feature files follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and are written in Gherkin format for use with Cucumber.

## Feature File Overview

The ALZ001 test suite includes the following feature files:

1. **alz001-protein-expression-baseline.feature**: Tests for protein expression patterns related to Alzheimer's disease
2. **alz001-neuronal-network-structure.feature**: Tests for neuronal network topology and degradation
3. **alz001-time-series-analysis.feature**: Tests for time series data analysis and pattern detection
4. **alz001-environmental-factors.feature**: Tests for modeling environmental influences on disease progression
5. **alz001-predictive-modeling.feature**: Tests for machine learning models to predict disease progression
6. **alz001-system-integration.feature**: Tests for end-to-end integration of all capabilities

## Test Structure

All feature files follow a consistent structure organized according to the following principles:

### 1. Hierarchical Levels

Tests are categorized by architectural complexity:

- **L0_Component**: Tests for individual components in isolation
- **L1_Composite**: Tests for composites that coordinate multiple components
- **L2_Machine**: Tests for machines that implement complex behaviors using composites
- **L3_System**: Tests for full system integration

### 2. Biological Lifecycle Phases

Tests are categorized according to lifecycle phases:

- **Conception**: Initial creation and basic parameter validation
- **Embryonic**: Structure formation and configuration
- **Infancy**: Basic functionality
- **Maturity**: Advanced functionality and integration

### 3. Test Types

- **Positive**: Tests for expected behaviors under normal conditions
- **Negative**: Tests for error handling and edge cases

### 4. Capabilities

Tests are categorized by domain capabilities:

- **ProteinExpression**: Modeling protein expression patterns
- **NeuronalNetwork**: Modeling neuronal network structure and degradation
- **TimeSeriesAnalysis**: Analyzing time series data
- **EnvironmentalFactors**: Modeling environmental influences
- **PredictiveModeling**: Creating predictive disease models
- **SystemIntegration**: End-to-end integration

## Feature File Format

Each feature file follows this format:

1. **Copyright Header**: Standard copyright information
2. **Feature Tags**: `@ALZ001` plus capability-specific tag
3. **Feature Description**: User story format with As/I want/So that structure
4. **Background**: Common setup steps for all scenarios
5. **Scenarios**: Multiple scenarios with Given/When/Then structure
   - Tagged with level, lifecycle phase, and test type
   - Organized from basic to complex functionality
   - Include both positive and negative test cases
   - Use data tables for complex inputs

## Consistency Verification

All feature files have been reviewed for consistency across:

1. **Structure**: Background sections, scenario organization, and step patterns
2. **Tags**: Proper tagging with capability, level, lifecycle phase, and test type
3. **Data Tables**: Consistent format for complex data inputs
4. **Coverage**: Representation across all hierarchy levels and test types
5. **Error Handling**: Inclusion of negative test cases for validation and edge cases

## Running the Tests

Once implemented, the tests can be run using:

```bash
# Run all ALZ001 tests
./s8r-test ALZ001

# Run specific capability tests
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@ProteinExpression"
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@NeuronalNetwork"
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@TimeSeriesAnalysis"
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@EnvironmentalFactors"
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@PredictiveModeling"
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@SystemIntegration"

# Run tests at a specific level
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@L0_Component"

# Run tests at a specific lifecycle phase
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@Maturity"

# Run only positive or negative tests
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@Positive"
./s8r-test ALZ001 --tags "@Negative"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Architecture Design**: Create a cohesive architecture for implementing the step definitions, including:
   - Common mock implementations for biological structures
   - Shared context and data exchange mechanisms
   - Interface definitions for interacting with the Samstraumr framework
   - Testing utilities for validation and verification

2. **Step Definition Implementation**: Based on the architecture, implement the step definitions for all feature files:
   - Focus on realistic mock behavior that represents the actual system
   - Ensure proper validation of success criteria
   - Maintain state consistency throughout test execution
   - Implement robust error handling for negative test cases

3. **Test Runner Configuration**: Ensure proper discovery and execution of all tests:
   - Configure Cucumber to find all feature files and step definitions
   - Set up test tagging for selective execution
   - Integrate with the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the test suite:
   - Architectural overview and design decisions
   - Implementation guidelines for new tests
   - Usage instructions for running and interpreting tests
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Use composition to share functionality between step definition classes
2. **Mock Implementation**: Create realistic mock implementations for testing without actual implementation
3. **Context Sharing**: Use a shared test context for communication between steps
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Implement from component level up to system level
5. **Independent Validation**: Ensure each step can validate its own success criteria
