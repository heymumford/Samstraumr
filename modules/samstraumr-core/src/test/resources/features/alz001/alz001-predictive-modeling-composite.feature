Feature: Predictive Modeling Composite in Alzheimer's Disease Research
  As a neurodegenerative disease researcher
  I want to use predictive modeling capabilities for Alzheimer's disease
  So that I can forecast disease progression and optimize interventions

  Background:
    Given the Predictive Modeling Composite system is initialized

  Scenario: Creating a basic predictive modeling composite
    When I create a predictive modeling composite named "BasicPredictiveComposite"
    Then the composite should be successfully created
    And the composite type should be "PREDICTIVE_MODELING"
    And the composite should have the correct configuration

  Scenario: Adding predictive modeling components to a composite
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "ComponentPredictiveComposite"
    When I add a neural network component to the composite
    And I add a biomarker analysis component to the composite
    And I connect the neural network component to the biomarker component
    Then the composite should contain 2 child components
    And the components should be properly connected
    And I should be able to retrieve each component by name

  Scenario: Creating and training predictive models
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "ModelTrainingComposite"
    When I create a neural network model named "AlzheimerNN"
    And I create a random forest model named "AlzheimerRF"
    And I create a clinical data source with 500 samples
    And I train the "AlzheimerNN" model on the clinical data source
    And I train the "AlzheimerRF" model on the clinical data source
    Then both models should be marked as trained
    And both models should have performance metrics
    And the neural network model should have an accuracy above 0.7

  Scenario: Creating and using model ensembles
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "EnsembleComposite"
    And I have trained multiple predictive models
    When I create an ensemble named "AlzheimerEnsemble" using the voting method
    And I add all trained models to the ensemble
    Then the ensemble should contain all the models
    And the ensemble should have weights assigned to each model
    And the ensemble performance should be higher than the average model performance

  Scenario: Patient cohort management and risk prediction
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "CohortComposite"
    And I have a trained predictive model
    When I create a patient cohort with 30 patients
    And I predict biomarker levels for all patients in the cohort
    Then each patient should have a predicted biomarker level
    And I should be able to stratify patients by risk level
    And high-risk patients should have higher biomarker levels

  Scenario: Intervention plan evaluation
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "InterventionComposite"
    And I have a high-risk patient cohort
    And I have a trained predictive model
    When I create a pharmacological intervention plan
    And I create a lifestyle intervention plan
    And I create a comprehensive intervention plan
    And I evaluate all intervention plans on the high-risk cohort
    Then each intervention plan should have an efficacy score
    And the comprehensive plan should have the highest efficacy
    And I should be able to simulate the effect of interventions over time

  Scenario: Clinical decision support system
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "ClinicalComposite"
    And I have a fully configured predictive modeling system
    When I generate a clinical report for a high-risk patient
    Then the report should contain patient information
    And the report should contain a risk assessment
    And the report should contain intervention recommendations
    And the report should contain predicted disease trajectories
    And the recommended interventions should be ranked by efficacy

  Scenario: Feature importance analysis
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "FeatureImportanceComposite"
    And I have a trained random forest model with Alzheimer's features
    When I analyze the feature importance of the model
    Then APOE genotype should be among the top features
    And amyloid beta levels should be among the top features
    And tau protein levels should be among the top features
    And the feature importance scores should sum to approximately 1.0

  Scenario: Hyperparameter optimization
    Given I have a predictive modeling composite named "HyperparameterComposite"
    And I have a predictive model with initial parameters
    When I create a parameter grid for optimization
    And I optimize the model hyperparameters
    Then the optimized parameters should differ from the initial parameters
    And the model performance should improve after optimization

  Scenario: Creating a comprehensive predictive modeling system
    When I create a fully configured predictive modeling composite
    Then the composite should contain multiple predictive components
    And the composite should have standard models created
    And the composite should have standard data sources created
    And the composite should have standard cohorts created
    And the composite should have standard intervention plans created
    And all models should be trained and ready for predictions
