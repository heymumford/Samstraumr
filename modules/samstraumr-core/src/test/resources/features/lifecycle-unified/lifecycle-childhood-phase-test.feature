Feature: Tube Functional Identity - Childhood Phase
  As a system architect
  I want tubes to establish proper functional identity during childhood phase
  So that they can perform their intended operations reliably

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured
    And a tube has completed its embryonic development phase
    And the tube is in the "ACTIVE" lifecycle state

@FunctionalIdentity @DataProcessing @Positive @Childhood @L0_Tube @Function @DataFlow
  Scenario: Tube processes data correctly during childhood phase
    When the tube receives a standard data input
    Then the tube should process the input according to its function
    And the tube should produce expected output
    And the processing should be recorded in operational logs
    
@FunctionalIdentity @StateLearning @Positive @Childhood @L0_Tube @Function @State @Learning
  Scenario: Tube learns from operational experience during childhood phase
    When the tube completes multiple processing operations
    Then the tube should optimize its internal pathways
    And the tube should develop operational patterns
    And the tube should show improved efficiency metrics
    
@ErrorHandling  @FunctionalIdentity @ErrorRecovery @Negative @Childhood @L0_Tube @Function @Resilience
  Scenario: Tube recovers from processing errors during childhood phase
    When the tube encounters a processing error
    Then the tube should safely handle the error condition
    And the tube should attempt to recover operational state
    And the tube should learn from the error experience
