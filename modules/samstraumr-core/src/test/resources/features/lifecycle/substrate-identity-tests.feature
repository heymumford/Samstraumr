/*
Filename: substrate-identity-tests.feature
Purpose: Validates the Substrate Identity aspects of the Tube Lifecycle model.
Goals:
  - Ensure tubes establish proper identity following the biological model
  - Validate unique identification with immutable properties
  - Test lineage management and hierarchical addressing
  - Verify environmental context capture
Dependencies:
  - BDD step definitions in org.s8r.tube.lifecycle.steps package
  - Tube and Environment implementations in org.s8r.tube
Assumptions:
  - Test environment provides stable resource conditions
  - Cucumber test runner is properly configured
  - Test tags are consistent with the test ontology

Feature: Tube Substrate Identity (Biological Continuity Analog)
  The Substrate Identity model ensures that tubes maintain a persistent, foundational
  identity similar to the biological continuity model in living organisms. This feature
  tests the aspects of tube identity that correspond to the physical, immutable
  characteristics of an organism.

  @ATL @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Creation @S8R_EPIC-1.1
  Scenario: Tube generates a unique identifier during creation
    Given a prepared environment for tube creation
    When a tube is created with reason "Initial Identity Test"
    Then the tube should have a unique identifier
    And the identifier should include a creation timestamp
    And the identifier should not be modifiable

  @ATL @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Creation @S8R_EPIC-1.2
  Scenario: Tube records precise creation metadata
    Given a prepared environment for tube creation
    When a tube is created with reason "Creation Tracking Test"
    Then the tube should record a precise creation timestamp
    And the tube should capture the complete environmental context
    And the tube's birth certificate should contain the reason "Creation Tracking Test"

  @ATL @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Creation @S8R_EPIC-1.3
  Scenario: Parent tube establishes lineage with child tubes
    Given a prepared environment for tube creation
    And a parent tube with reason "Parent Tube"
    When a child tube is created from the parent with reason "Child Tube"
    Then the child tube should have its own unique identifier
    And the child tube should reference its parent in its lineage
    And the parent tube should track its child in descendants

  @ATL @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Creation @S8R_EPIC-1.4
  Scenario: Tubes support hierarchical addressing
    Given a tube ecosystem with multiple hierarchical levels
    When a tube is addressed using its hierarchical identifier
    Then the system should locate the correct tube
    And the addressing should work at any level of the hierarchy
    And the tube's address should update if its position changes

  @ATL @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Creation @S8R_EPIC-1.5
  Scenario: Tube captures detailed environmental context at creation
    Given a prepared environment with specific resource conditions
    When a tube is created with reason "Environmental Context Test"
    Then the tube should record the available hardware resources
    And the tube should capture the operating system details
    And the tube should record the network environment
    And the environmental context should be immutable
