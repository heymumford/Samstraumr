Feature: Component Lifecycle Resource Management
  As a framework developer
  I want components to manage resources properly throughout their lifecycle
  So that resources are allocated when needed and released when done

  Background:
    Given the S8r framework is initialized

  @smoke
  Scenario: Component allocates resources during initialization
    When I create a component with monitored resources
    Then memory resources should be allocated
    And thread resources should be allocated
    And timer resources should be allocated
    And connection resources should be allocated
    And all resources should be tracked

  Scenario: Component releases resources during termination
    Given a component with allocated resources
    When I terminate the component
    Then memory resources should be released
    And thread resources should be released
    And timer resources should be released
    And connection resources should be released
    And resource release should be logged
    And no resource leaks should occur

  Scenario: Component manages resources across state transitions
    Given a component with allocated resources
    When I transition the component to "SUSPENDED" state
    Then non-essential resources should be released
    But essential resources should be maintained
    When I transition the component to "ACTIVE" state
    Then all required resources should be re-allocated
    When I transition the component to "MAINTENANCE" state
    Then additional diagnostic resources should be allocated
    When I transition the component to "ACTIVE" state
    Then diagnostic resources should be released
    When I terminate the component
    Then all resources should be released

  Scenario: Resource allocation respects configured limits
    Given a component with resource limits configured:
      | memory_limit     | 100MB   |
      | thread_limit     | 5       |
      | connection_limit | 10      |
      | timer_limit      | 20      |
    When I create the component
    Then resource allocation should respect configured limits
    When I attempt to exceed resource limits
    Then resource limit exceptions should be thrown
    And the component should handle the resource constraints gracefully

  Scenario: Resource allocation is tracked and reported
    Given a component with resource tracking enabled
    When I perform operations that allocate and release resources
    Then resource allocation metrics should be updated
    And resource usage should be reported correctly
    And resource tracking should have minimal overhead

  @ErrorHandling @BTL
  Scenario: Component handles resource allocation failures
    Given a system with resource constraints
    When I create a component with resource allocation that will fail
    Then the component should handle the failure gracefully
    And partial resources should be released
    And appropriate exceptions should be thrown
    And the failure should be logged

  Scenario: Component with active timers handles termination properly
    Given a component with active timer callbacks scheduled
    When I terminate the component
    Then all timers should be cancelled
    And no timer callbacks should execute after termination
    And timer resources should be released

  @Resilience
  Scenario: Component recovers from resource exhaustion
    Given a component near its resource limits
    When I simulate temporary resource exhaustion
    Then the component should enter resource conservation mode
    And non-essential operations should be postponed
    And the component should log resource warnings
    When resources become available again
    Then the component should recover normal operation
    And postponed operations should resume
