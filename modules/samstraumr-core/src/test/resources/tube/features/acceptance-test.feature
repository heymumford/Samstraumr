@L3_System @Functional @DataFlow @TubeAcceptance @ATL
Feature: Tube-Based Data Processing System Acceptance
  As a business user
  I want a robust tube-based data processing system
  So that I can reliably process business data with adaptive capabilities

  Background:
    Given the Samstraumr tube system is initialized
    And the system is configured for business use

  @Functional @Identity
  Scenario: New tube-based processing system should have a unique identity
    When I query the system identity
    Then the system should have a valid UUID
    And the system should have a human-readable name
    And the system should report its version information
    And the tube hierarchy should be correctly established

  @Functional @DataFlow @Transformer
  Scenario: Tube system should process customer data correctly
    Given the following customer data:
      | customer_id | name          | email                  | subscription |
      | C1001       | John Smith    | john.smith@example.com | Premium      |
      | C1002       | Jane Doe      | jane.doe@example.com   | Basic        |
      | C1003       | Bob Johnson   | bob.j@example.com      | Premium      |
    When I process the customer data through the tube transformation system
    Then the system should successfully process all records
    And premium customer data should be flagged for priority handling
    And customer email addresses should be properly anonymized
    And the Mimir journal should record the complete processing history

  @Functional @Filter
  Scenario: Tube system should reject invalid business data
    Given the following invalid customer data:
      | customer_id | name          | email                | subscription |
      | C2001       | Alex White    | not-an-email         | Premium      |
      | C2002       |               | jane.doe@example.com | Basic        |
      | C2003       | Maria Garcia  | maria@example.com    | InvalidTier  |
    When I process the customer data through the tube system
    Then the system should reject all invalid records
    And detailed validation errors should be provided for each record
    And the system should maintain a clean state
    And the rejection patterns should be stored for future reference

  @Functional @Performance
  Scenario: Tube system should meet business performance requirements
    Given a batch of 1000 standard business records
    When I process the batch with timing through the tube network
    Then the processing should complete within 5 seconds
    And resource usage should remain below critical thresholds
    And all records should be properly processed
    And the system should adapt to processing patterns for future optimization

  @Functional @Resilience
  Scenario: Tube system should recover from external service failures
    Given the external data service is unavailable
    When I attempt to process business data requiring the external service
    Then the tube system should gracefully handle the service failure
    And the system should retry the operation according to business policy
    And after external service recovery, processing should succeed
    And the failure-recovery pattern should be recorded in the Mimir

  @Functional @State @Monitoring
  Scenario: Tube system should maintain auditable processing history
    Given the system contains previously processed business data
    When I request an audit report for processing activities
    Then the report should include all processing operations
    And the report should include timestamps for all operations
    And the report should identify the source and destination of all data
    And the report should comply with business retention policies
    And the Mimir should provide context for processing decisions

  @Functional @SelfOptimization
  Scenario: Tube system should self-optimize based on processing patterns
    Given the tube system has processed 10,000 business transactions
    When I analyze system performance metrics
    Then the system should show evidence of self-optimization
    And recurring processing patterns should be handled with increased efficiency
    And resource allocation should be optimized for common workflows
    And the optimization decisions should be documented in the Mimir journal

  @Functional @AdaptiveCapacity
  Scenario: Tube system should adapt to changing business data patterns
    Given the tube system is trained on standard business data patterns
    When new data patterns are introduced:
      | pattern_type    | deviation_from_norm | business_impact |
      | seasonal_spike  | +200%               | high            |
      | new_data_format | structural change   | medium          |
      | mixed_quality   | variable validity    | high            |
    Then the tube system should adapt to each new pattern
    And adaptation metrics should show improved handling over time
    And business impact should be minimized during adaptation periods
    And learned adaptations should be retained for future similar patterns

  @Functional @KnowledgeSharing
  Scenario: Tube components should share processing knowledge within the system
    Given a distributed tube system with specialized processing components
    When a component discovers an optimal processing technique
    Then the knowledge should propagate to relevant companion components
    And overall system performance should improve as knowledge spreads
    And knowledge sharing patterns should be visible in component interactions
    And the shared knowledge should be refined through collaborative use

  @Functional @EnvironmentalResponse
  Scenario Outline: Tube system adapts processing approach to business environment
    Given the tube system is operating in <business_environment> conditions
    When processing <data_volume> business transactions with <priority_profile>
    Then the system should adjust its <adjustment_parameter> to optimize for <optimization_goal>
    And resource allocation should align with <resource_strategy>
    And adaptation should occur within <adaptation_timeframe> timeframe
    And business continuity should be maintained throughout adaptation

    Examples:
      | business_environment | data_volume | priority_profile | adjustment_parameter | optimization_goal  | resource_strategy      | adaptation_timeframe |
      | peak_hours           | high        | mixed            | processing_sequence  | throughput         | maximize_parallelism   | immediate            |
      | off_hours            | low         | low_priority     | resource_allocation  | energy_efficiency  | consolidate_processing | gradual              |
      | month_end            | very_high   | high_priority    | scaling_policy       | reliability        | elastic_scaling        | rapid                |
      | recovery_mode        | backlogged  | tiered           | queue_management     | catch_up_time      | triage_based           | phased               |
      | maintenance_window   | minimal     | essential_only   | component_activity   | service_continuity | minimal_footprint      | scheduled            |

  @Functional @Lifecycle @BusinessAlignment
  Scenario: Tube system aligns lifecycle with business operations calendar
    Given a tube system supporting critical business operations
    When the business enters its annual planning cycle
    Then the tube system should prepare knowledge consolidation
    And system insights should be formatted for executive review
    And optimization recommendations should be generated
    And historical performance trends should be analyzed
    And strategic adaptation plan should be prepared for the next cycle

  @Functional @LegacyIntegration
  Scenario: Tube system integrates with legacy business systems
    Given the following legacy systems are in the business environment:
      | system_name     | technology    | data_format | update_frequency |
      | inventory       | mainframe     | fixed-width | daily-batch      |
      | accounting      | client-server | XML         | near-real-time   |
      | customer_records| mixed-legacy  | proprietary | weekly-batch     |
    When the tube system interfaces with each legacy system
    Then data exchange should occur reliably with each system
    And data format transformations should happen automatically
    And integration should accommodate each system's update frequency
    And the tube system should build adapters for optimal communication
