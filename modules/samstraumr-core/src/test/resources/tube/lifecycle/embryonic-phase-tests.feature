Feature: Tube Structural Identity - Embryonic Phase
  As a system architect
  I want tubes to establish proper structural identity during embryonic phase
  So that they can form the basis for reliable functionality and connectivity

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured
    And a new tube has been created

  @StructuralIdentity @ConnectionPoints @Positive @Embryonic @L0_Tube @ATL @Structure
  Scenario: Tube develops proper connection points during embryonic phase
    When the tube develops its connection framework
    Then the tube should have input connection points
    And the tube should have output connection points
    And the connection points should have proper identifiers
    
  @StructuralIdentity @InternalStructure @Positive @Embryonic @L0_Tube @ATL @Structure
  Scenario: Tube develops internal structure during embryonic phase
    When the tube establishes its internal structure
    Then the tube should have a processing mechanism
    And the tube should have state containers
    And the tube should have defined operational boundaries
    
  @StructuralIdentity @ErrorHandling @Negative @Embryonic @L0_Tube @BTL @Structure @Resilience
  Scenario: Tube handles structural malformation during embryonic phase
    When the tube encounters a structural anomaly during development
    Then the tube should attempt structural self-correction
    And the tube should report the anomaly to the environment
    And the tube should establish a fallback functional mode
