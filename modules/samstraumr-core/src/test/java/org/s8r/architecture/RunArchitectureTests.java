/**
 * Test suite that runs all architecture-related tests. This includes tests for C4 diagram
 * generation, Architecture Decision Records, and validation tests for each ADR implementation.
 *
 * <p>The tests in this suite verify compliance with all the architectural decisions documented in
 * our ADRs, including:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>ADR-0003: Clean Architecture for System Design
 *   <li>ADR-0005: Package Structure Alignment with Clean Architecture
 *   <li>ADR-0006: Comprehensive Testing Pyramid Strategy
 *   <li>ADR-0007: Component-Based Architecture for System Modularity
 *   <li>ADR-0008: Hierarchical Identity System
 *   <li>ADR-0009: Lifecycle State Management Pattern
 *   <li>ADR-0010: Event-Driven Communication Model
 *   <li>ADR-0011: Standardized Error Handling Strategy
 *   <li>ADR-0012: Enforce Acyclic Dependencies
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The test suite also includes various architectural analysis tools and utilities to assist in
 * verifying compliance with these architectural decisions.
 *
 * <p>To run just these architecture tests, use:
 *
 * <pre>
 * mvn test -Dtest=RunArchitectureTests
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For faster execution during development, you can run specific architecture tests:
 *
 * <pre>
 * mvn test -Dtest=CleanArchitectureComplianceTest,AcyclicDependencyTest
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Or use our dedicated script with different modes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ./run-architecture-tests.sh              # Run all architecture tests
 * ./run-architecture-tests.sh quick        # Run only critical tests (faster)
 * ./run-architecture-tests.sh critical     # Run a subset of important tests
 * </pre>
