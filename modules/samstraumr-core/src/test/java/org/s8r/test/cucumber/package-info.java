/**
 * Provides Cucumber BDD testing infrastructure for the S8r framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains test runners, step definitions, and test context classes specifically
 * designed for testing the new S8r core components using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with
 * Cucumber.
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package are organized into the following categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Runners: Classes that configure and execute Cucumber tests
 *   <li>Steps: Step definition classes that implement the Gherkin scenarios
 *   <li>Context: Test context classes that maintain state between steps
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package is part of the test infrastructure for the new S8r framework, distinct from the
 * legacy test infrastructure. It focuses on testing the new components in the org.s8r.core package
 * structure.
