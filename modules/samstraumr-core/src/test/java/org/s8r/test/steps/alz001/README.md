## Test Structure

Tests are organized according to the Samstraumr hierarchical structure:

- **L2_Machine**: Tests for machines that implement complex behaviors
- **L3_System**: Tests for full system integration

Each test is also categorized by lifecycle phase:

- **Conception**: Initial creation and parameter validation
- **Embryonic**: Structure formation and configuration
- **Infancy**: Basic functionality
- **Maturity**: Advanced functionality and integration

### Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Implement mock components**: Create mock components for each capability
2. **Update step definitions**: Refactor existing step definitions to use the new architecture
3. **Complete step definitions**: Implement SystemIntegrationSteps.java
4. **Update test runner**: Update ALZ001Tests.java to use the new cucumber-alz001.properties file
5. **Run full test suite**: Execute and validate the complete ALZ001 test suite
6. **Update documentation**: Ensure all test documentation is complete and accurate

## Implementation Notes

- The tests use a well-defined architecture with thread-safe context sharing
- Mock components extend a common base class with standardized state management
- Factory methods ensure consistent component creation and configuration
- Tests share a common context through `ALZ001TestContext`

## Known Issues

- Cucumber test discovery may have issues with the current Maven configuration
- Some test dependencies may need to be updated
- JUnit Simple test runs successfully, but Cucumber integration requires additional configuration
