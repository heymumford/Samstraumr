# ALZ001 L3_System Layer Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the L3_System layer for the ALZ001 test suite, which is the highest layer in the ALZ001 testing hierarchy.

## Overview

The L3_System layer focuses on orchestrating multiple specialized L2_Machine instances in a comprehensive system that enables advanced cross-scale analysis for Alzheimer's disease research. This layer implements:

1. Multi-machine orchestration
2. Cross-machine data exchange
3. Multi-modal dataset integration
4. Coordinated simulation execution
5. Cross-scale analysis
6. Failure recovery mechanisms
7. Clinical recommendation generation

## Components

### 1. System Orchestrator

The `ALZ001SystemOrchestrator` class serves as the central coordination point for multiple specialized machines, providing the following core capabilities:

- **Machine Management**: Add, configure, and monitor multiple specialized machines
- **Data Exchange**: Establish data flow protocols between different machines
- **Execution Strategies**: Support for different simulation execution strategies (staged parallel, fully parallel, sequential)
- **Failure Handling**: Detect and recover from machine failures
- **Cross-Scale Analysis**: Analyze interactions across different biological scales
- **Clinical Insights**: Generate actionable clinical recommendations

### 2. Step Definitions

The `AdvancedSystemOrchestrationSteps` class implements the Cucumber step definitions for testing the system orchestration capabilities, including:

- Creating a multi-machine orchestration system
- Adding specialized machines to the orchestration system
- Configuring cross-machine data exchange
- Loading multi-modal datasets
- Executing coordinated simulations
- Simulating and recovering from machine failures
- Analyzing cross-scale interactions
- Generating clinical recommendations
- Verifying system performance metrics

## Test Execution

Use the `ALZ001AdvancedSystemOrchestrationTests` test runner to execute the L3_System layer tests:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=ALZ001AdvancedSystemOrchestrationTests
```

Or run the complete ALZ001 test suite including all layers:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=ALZ001AllTests
```

## Feature File

The `alz001-advanced-system-orchestration.feature` file defines the BDD scenarios for testing the L3_System layer, including:

- Creating a multi-machine orchestration system
- Configuring cross-machine data exchange
- Loading multi-modal datasets
- Executing coordinated simulations with different strategies
- Handling machine failures
- Analyzing cross-scale interactions
- Generating clinical recommendations

## Test Hierarchy

The L3_System layer sits at the top of the ALZ001 test hierarchy:

1. **L1_Composite**: Individual biological modeling components
2. **L2_Machine**: Specialized machines that integrate multiple composites
3. **L3_System**: System orchestration of multiple specialized machines

This hierarchical approach enables comprehensive testing of Alzheimer's disease modeling across all biological scales.
