# ALZ001 Component-Level Mock Implementations

This directory contains mock implementations for component-level (L0) test classes. Each component represents a basic building block of the ALZ001 test suite.

## Planned Contents

- `ProteinExpressionComponent.java`: Mock component for protein expression modeling
- `NeuronalNetworkComponent.java`: Mock component for neuronal networks
- `TimeSeriesAnalysisComponent.java`: Mock component for time series analysis
- `EnvironmentalFactorsComponent.java`: Mock component for environmental factors
- `PredictiveModelingComponent.java`: Mock component for predictive modeling

## Usage

All components should extend `ALZ001MockComponent` and should be created using the appropriate factory method in `ALZ001MockFactory`.
