/**
 * Port interfaces for the component domain model - a key part of the Clean Architecture
 * implementation.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the port interfaces that define the contracts for components in the
 * domain layer. These interfaces are a crucial part of implementing the Dependency Inversion
 * Principle (DIP) from SOLID principles and Clean Architecture.
 *
 * <p>Key interfaces in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.port.ComponentPort} - Base interface for all components
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.port.CompositeComponentPort} - Interface for composite
 *       components that can contain other components
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.port.MachinePort} - Interface for machines that orchestrate
 *       composites
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Benefits of using these port interfaces:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Higher-level modules (application layer) depend on abstractions (these interfaces) rather
 *       than concrete implementations
 *   <li>Domain rules can be expressed through these interfaces while implementations can vary
 *   <li>Legacy implementations can be adapted to these interfaces without changing the domain model
 *   <li>Testing is simplified since mock implementations can be provided
 *   <li>The system becomes more modular and maintainable
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation notes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The adapter package provides adapter implementations that convert between concrete domain
 *       entities and these interfaces
 *   <li>Repositories in the application layer work with these port interfaces rather than concrete
 *       implementations
 *   <li>Domain events can be raised by both concrete implementations and port interface
 *       implementations
 *   <li>Infrastructure components only depend on these interfaces, not on concrete domain
 *       implementations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Related packages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component} - Concrete component implementations
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.adapter} - Adapters that convert between domain entities and these port
 *       interfaces
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.application.port} - Application layer ports that use these domain interfaces
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.infrastructure.persistence} - Infrastructure implementations that store and
 *       retrieve these interfaces
 * </ul>
