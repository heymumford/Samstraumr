/**
 * Component domain model in the Samstraumr framework - core building blocks of the system.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the domain model for components, which are the fundamental building
 * blocks of the Samstraumr framework. Components encapsulate domain logic and behavior, forming the
 * heart of the business rules in Clean Architecture.
 *
 * <p>The component domain model follows these principles:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Rich Domain Model - Components contain both data and behavior
 *   <li>Domain-Driven Design - Components map to concepts in the problem domain
 *   <li>Entity Pattern - Components have identity and lifecycle
 *   <li>Aggregate Pattern - Components can form hierarchical structures
 *   <li>Event-Driven - Components raise domain events when significant things happen
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.Component} - Domain component entity
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Clean Architecture Integration</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Components are part of the domain layer, the innermost circle of Clean Architecture
 *   <li>Port interfaces in {@link org.s8r.domain.component.port} define abstractions that
 *       higher-level modules can depend on
 *   <li>Adapter implementations in {@link org.s8r.adapter} convert between concrete implementations
 *       and port interfaces
 *   <li>Domain events in {@link org.s8r.domain.event} allow components to notify other parts of the
 *       system without direct dependencies
 *   <li>Application services in {@link org.s8r.application.service} orchestrate components to
 *       fulfill use cases
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Subpackages</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.composite} - Composite component domain entities
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.pattern} - Pattern-based domain entities
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.monitoring} - Component monitoring entities
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.port} - Port interfaces for Clean Architecture
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Related Packages</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.event} - Domain events related to components
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.identity} - Identity management for components
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.lifecycle} - Lifecycle states for components
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.machine} - Higher-level structures that use components
