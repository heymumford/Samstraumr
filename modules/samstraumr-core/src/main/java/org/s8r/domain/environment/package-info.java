/**
 * Contains classes for modeling and representing environmental factors that influence tube
 * behavior, particularly the choice between immortality and reproduction survival strategies.
 *
 * <p>The environment package provides abstractions to model environmental conditions such as
 * resource availability, environmental stability, hostility levels, and other factors that tubes
 * consider when selecting a survival strategy.
 *
 * <p>The core conceptual model is that a tube's environment determines its survival strategy: if
 * the environment is not nurturing, the tube will choose immortality, focusing on self-sufficiency
 * and self-management. Conversely, if the habitat is favorable, the tube will choose to reproduce,
 * transferring essential knowledge to the next generation before terminating.

 * @since 3.0.3
