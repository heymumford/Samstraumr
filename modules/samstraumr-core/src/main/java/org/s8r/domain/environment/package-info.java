/**
 * Contains classes for modeling and representing environmental factors
 * that influence tube behavior, particularly the choice between immortality
 * and reproduction survival strategies.
 * <p>
 * The environment package provides abstractions to model environmental
 * conditions such as resource availability, environmental stability,
 * hostility levels, and other factors that tubes consider when selecting
 * a survival strategy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The core conceptual model is that a tube's environment determines its
 * survival strategy: if the environment is not nurturing, the tube will
 * choose immortality, focusing on self-sufficiency and self-management.
 * Conversely, if the habitat is favorable, the tube will choose to
 * reproduce, transferring essential knowledge to the next generation
 * before terminating.
