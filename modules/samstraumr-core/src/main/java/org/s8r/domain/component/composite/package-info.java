/**
 * Composite component domain model.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the domain model for composite components, which are containers that can
 * hold and manage multiple child components. Composites form a crucial part of the S8r framework's
 * structural model, implementing the Composite design pattern.
 *
 * <p>Key classes in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.composite.CompositeComponent} - Core composite entity
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.composite.CompositeException} - Domain exceptions
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.composite.CompositeFactory} - Factory for creating
 *       composites
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each composite supports adding, removing, and connecting components, providing a hierarchical
 * structure that can represent complex systems. Composites implement the Component interface,
 * allowing them to be treated uniformly with simple components.
 *
 * <p>Integration with Clean Architecture:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Composites are part of the domain layer, containing core business logic
 *   <li>Port interfaces ({@link org.s8r.domain.component.port.CompositeComponentPort}) define the
 *       contract that allows adapter implementations to work with composites
 *   <li>Adapter implementations ({@link org.s8r.adapter.ComponentAdapter}) convert between concrete
 *       CompositeComponent implementations and CompositeComponentPort interfaces
 *   <li>This ensures higher-level modules (application layer) can depend on abstractions instead of
 *       concrete implementations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Related packages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component.port} - Port interfaces for composites
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component} - Base component model
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.machine} - Higher-level structures that use composites
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.adapter} - Adapters for composite components
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.component.composite} - Legacy composite abstraction layer
 * </ul>
