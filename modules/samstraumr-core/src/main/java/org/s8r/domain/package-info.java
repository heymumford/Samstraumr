/**
 * Domain layer of the Samstraumr framework following Clean Architecture principles.
 *
 * <p>This package and its subpackages contain the domain model that forms the core business logic
 * of the S8r framework. The domain layer is independent of external frameworks, databases, and user
 * interfaces.
 *
 * <h2>Subpackages</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.component} - Component domain model
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.event} - Domain events
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.identity} - Identity domain model
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.machine} - Machine domain model
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.lifecycle} - Lifecycle management
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.domain.exception} - Domain exceptions
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Clean Architecture</h2>
 *
 * <p>This layer follows Clean Architecture principles:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Framework Independence: No dependencies on external frameworks
 *   <li>Testability: Business rules can be tested without UI, database, etc.
 *   <li>UI Independence: UI can change without changing business rules
 *   <li>Database Independence: Business rules not bound to a specific database
 *   <li>Independence from External Agencies: Business rules don't know about interfaces to the
 *       outside world
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Related Packages</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.application.service} - Application services that use domain model
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.application.port} - Ports to interact with the domain model
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.infrastructure.persistence} - Repository implementations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For detailed information about the domain layer organization and design principles, see the
 * README.md file in this package directory.
