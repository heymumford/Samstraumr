/**
 * Contains classes for implementing the Tube concept in the Samstraumr framework,
 * particularly focusing on tube survival strategies (immortality vs. reproduction)
 * based on environmental conditions.
 * <p>
 * The tube package implements the conceptual statement: "The mass of the tube 
 * has only two solutions: be immortal or reproduce. If the environment is not 
 * nurturing, the tube will choose immortality: self-sufficiency and self-management.
 * If the habitat is favorable, the tube will choose to reproduce. That way, when
 * it terminates, it hands down essential knowledge to the next tube, and so on."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key features implemented in this package:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Environment-based survival strategy selection</li>
 *   <li>Knowledge accumulation and prioritized transfer during reproduction</li>
 *   <li>Self-optimization mechanisms for immortality strategy</li>
 *   <li>Adaptation of strategies based on historical outcomes</li>
 *   <li>Handling of edge cases such as reproduction interruption and resource depletion</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>

 * @since 3.0.3
