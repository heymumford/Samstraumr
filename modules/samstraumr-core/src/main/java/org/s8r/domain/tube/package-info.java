/**
 * Contains classes for implementing the Tube concept in the Samstraumr framework, particularly
 * focusing on tube survival strategies (immortality vs. reproduction) based on environmental
 * conditions.
 *
 * <p>The tube package implements the conceptual statement: "The mass of the tube has only two
 * solutions: be immortal or reproduce. If the environment is not nurturing, the tube will choose
 * immortality: self-sufficiency and self-management. If the habitat is favorable, the tube will
 * choose to reproduce. That way, when it terminates, it hands down essential knowledge to the next
 * tube, and so on."
 *
 * <p>Key features implemented in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Environment-based survival strategy selection
 *   <li>Knowledge accumulation and prioritized transfer during reproduction
 *   <li>Self-optimization mechanisms for immortality strategy
 *   <li>Adaptation of strategies based on historical outcomes
 *   <li>Handling of edge cases such as reproduction interruption and resource depletion
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since 3.0.3
