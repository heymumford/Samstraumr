/**
 * Core package contains fundamental framework abstractions and implementations.
 *
 * <p>This package provides the core abstractions that form the foundation of the Samstraumr
 * framework. It includes base classes and interfaces that define the fundamental concepts of the
 * system, such as environment configuration, exception handling, and tube implementation. The core
 * package is a legacy package that is gradually being migrated to the Clean Architecture design.
 *
 * <p><b>Deprecation Notice:</b> This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be
 * gradually replaced by the domain, application, and infrastructure packages in the Clean
 * Architecture. New code should use those packages instead.
