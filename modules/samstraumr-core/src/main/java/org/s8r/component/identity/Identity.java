/**
 * Represents the identity of a component based on the biological continuity model.
 *
 * <p>This class is part of the clean architecture implementation, providing a dedicated identity
 * package for the component domain.
 *
 * <p>The Identity class encapsulates all aspects of a component's identity:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
 *   <li>Creation timestamp (conception time)
 *   <li>Lineage information (parent-child relationships)
 *   <li>Environmental context at creation
 *   <li>Creation reason and metadata
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Once created, the core identity properties are immutable, ensuring a stable foundation for a
 * component's existence throughout its lifecycle.
