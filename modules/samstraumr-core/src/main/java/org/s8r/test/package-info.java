/**
 * Test package provides testing infrastructure and utilities for the Samstraumr framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the testing framework components used throughout the Samstraumr
 * codebase, including test annotations, runners, and utilities. It supports the testing pyramid
 * implementation with clear separation between different test levels.
 *
 * <p>The test package is part of the main source code rather than test sources because it provides
 * reusable testing infrastructure that can be used by client code as well.
