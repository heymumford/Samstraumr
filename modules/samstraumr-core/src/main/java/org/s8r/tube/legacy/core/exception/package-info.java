/**
 * Tube legacy core exception package contains exceptions for legacy tube functionality.
 *
 * <p>This package provides exception types specific to the legacy tube architecture, maintained for
 * backward compatibility with older versions of the Samstraumr framework. These exceptions
 * represent error conditions that may occur during tube creation, initialization, or execution in
 * legacy systems.
 *
 * <p>Code in this package should not be used for new development. It exists solely to support
 * migration from legacy tube implementations to the new component architecture.
 *
 * <p><b>Deprecation Notice:</b> This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be removed
 * in a future version once all dependent systems have migrated to the new component architecture.
 * Use org.s8r.component.exception instead for new development.
