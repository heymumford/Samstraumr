/**
 * Tube package provides the core Tube abstractions and implementations.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the Tube concept, which is the original foundation of the Samstraumr
 * framework. Tubes represent atomic processing units that can be composed together to form more
 * complex processing structures. The tube package includes lifecycle management, identity, and
 * logging capabilities for tubes.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and is gradually being replaced by
 *     the org.s8r.component package in the new Clean Architecture. New code should use the
 *     component package instead.
