/**
 * Tube legacy core package contains core legacy tube implementations.
 *
 * <p>This package provides the core functionality of the legacy tube architecture for backward
 * compatibility with older versions of the Samstraumr framework. It contains fundamental tube
 * concepts like Environment, Tube, and TubeLogger from the original architecture.
 *
 * <p>Code in this package should not be used for new development. It exists solely to support
 * migration from legacy tube implementations to the new component architecture.
 *
 * <p><b>Deprecation Notice:</b> This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be removed
 * in a future version once all dependent systems have migrated to the new component architecture.
 * Use org.s8r.component.core instead for new development.
