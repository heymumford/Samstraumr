/**
 * Tube test package provides test support for the tube subsystem.

 * <p>This package contains test utilities and supporting classes specifically for testing tube
 * components and their interactions. It includes common base classes for tube tests, fixtures, and
 * test data generators.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and is gradually being replaced by
 *     the org.s8r.test package in the new Clean Architecture. New code should use the general test
 *     package instead.
