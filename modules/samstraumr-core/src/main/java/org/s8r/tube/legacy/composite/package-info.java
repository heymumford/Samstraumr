/**
 * Tube legacy composite package contains legacy composite tube implementations.
 *
 * <p>This package provides backward compatibility for composite tube functionality from older
 * versions of the Samstraumr framework. It contains legacy composite implementations that are
 * maintained for systems still using the original tube architecture but are in the process of
 * transitioning to the new component-based architecture.
 *
 * <p>Code in this package should not be used for new development. It exists solely to support
 * migration from legacy composite tube implementations to the new composite component architecture.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be removed in a future
 *     version once all dependent systems have migrated to the new component architecture. Use
 *     org.s8r.component.composite instead for new development.
