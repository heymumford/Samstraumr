/**
 * Tube composite package provides composite pattern implementation for tubes.
 *
 * <p>This package defines how tubes can be composed together to form more complex structures. It
 * includes the Composite pattern implementation that allows tubes to be treated uniformly whether
 * they are individual tubes or compositions of tubes. This is part of the original Samstraumr
 * architecture that is being migrated to Clean Architecture.
 *
 * <p><b>Deprecation Notice:</b> This package is part of the legacy architecture and is gradually
 * being replaced by org.s8r.component.composite in the new Clean Architecture. New code should use
 * the component composite package instead.
