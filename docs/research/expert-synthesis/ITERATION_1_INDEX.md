## DOCUMENT MAP

### 1. VALUE_FRAMEWORK_ITERATION_1.md
**Primary deliverable. Read this first.**
- **Size**: ~11,000 words, 9 sections
- **Format**: Markdown with tables, code blocks, structured narrative
- **Purpose**: Complete philosophical foundation for 45→20 item prioritization

**Contents**:
- **Part 1**: Value Definition Framework (5 dimensions defined)
- **Part 2**: Value Stack (4 tiers explained)
- **Part 3**: Core Tensions Identified (4 major tensions + resolutions)
- **Part 4**: Value Scoring Matrix (detailed rubric)

## DECISION FLOW (For Gate Checkpoints)

```
Week 4 (Gates 1 & 2)
├─ Gate 1: Consciousness formalization complete?
│  ├─ YES → Proceed with Ranks 3, 5, 44 (philosophical work)
│  └─ NO  → Revise approach; may need different grounding
│
└─ Gate 2: Metaphors improve learning speed?
   ├─ YES (>30% faster) → Invest in Ranks 22-25 (refactoring)
   └─ NO (no difference) → Skip refactoring; allocate elsewhere

Week 12 (Gate 3)
└─ Architecture sound? Bounded contexts clear?
   ├─ YES → Proceed to Phase 3 (experiments)
   └─ NO  → Rethink domain structure; delay by 1-2 weeks

Week 15 (Gate 4) 🔴 EXISTENTIAL
├─ Does single-point failure recovery work autonomously?
├─ YES (>70% recovery) → Self-healing narrative publication-viable
│  ├─ Continue Rank 42 (empirical paper) with confidence
│  └─ Proceed to papers
│
└─ NO (<20% recovery)  → Pivot narrative gracefully
   ├─ "Architecture enables recovery" (humans implement)
   ├─ Still publishable, different emphasis
   ├─ Update Rank 42 framing
   └─ Proceed to papers

Week 20 (Gate 5)
└─ Cascades localized? Events queue work? Experiments validate?
   ├─ YES → All core assumptions validated
   │  └─ Publish with confidence
   │
   └─ NO (some failures) → Some claims refuted
      └─ Publish with acknowledged limitations
```

## CONTINGENCY QUICK REFERENCE

### If Rank 36 (Consciousness Logger) Slips Past Week 4
- **Impact**: Cascades to Ranks 1, 2, 3, 5, 18, 27, 44 (consciousness work blocked)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritize immediately; maybe split into smaller tasks
  - Consider dedicated team + extra resources
  - Or, can early work proceed without 36? (Probably not)

### If GATE 4 Reveals NO Recovery
- **Impact**: Core "self-healing" narrative fails
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prepare alternate Rank 42 framing: "Architecture enables recovery"
  - Still publishable, different positioning
  - Emphasis shifts from autonomous healing to architectural support
  - Graceful pivot, not failure

### If Cognitive Load Study is Negative (Metaphors Don't Help)
- **Impact**: Refactoring (Ranks 22-25) loses ROI justification
- **Mitigation**:
  - Skip refactoring; allocate budget elsewhere
  - Refactor still improves code quality; publish as engineering contribution
  - Focus on research value instead of pedagogical value

### If Property-Based Testing Reveals Bugs
- **Impact**: State machine has gaps; could delay publication
- **Mitigation**:
  - Actually a positive finding! Shows testing value
  - Fix bugs (1-2 week delay)
  - Publish findings as part of validation story
  - "Testing revealed X bugs" is useful data
