## DEBATE SYNTHESIS SUMMARY

### Architecture Paradigm Agent vs Systems Theory Agent

**Architecture Says**: "Biological state machine is 8.5/10 novel, excellent design"  
**Systems Says**: "Recovery is a state label, not actual behavior (1/10 validation)"  
**Synthesis**: Both TRUE. Work is 70% done (design), needs 30% completion (validation)

### DDD Agent vs Testing Agent

**DDD Says**: "Domain not formalized; ubiquitous language scattered (6.5/10)"  
**Testing Says**: "State transitions 25% covered; properties undefined (25% coverage)"  
**Synthesis**: Same root cause. Serial remediation (domain→contracts→tests) unblocks both

### Evolution Agent vs Cognition Agent

**Evolution Says**: "98.8% architectural compliance; long-term viability HIGH"  
**Cognition Says**: "Developer cognitive load +200-300% baseline"  
**Synthesis**: NOT exclusive. Keep strict architecture; invest 55-60% of cognitive burden is accidental (addressable via tooling)
