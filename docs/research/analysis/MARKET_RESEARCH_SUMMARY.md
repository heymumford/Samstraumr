# Phase 1 Market Research Summary

**Purpose**: Data to inform decisions (not prescriptive). Use as reference during Feb 10-14 execution.

---

## 1. RECRUITER MARKET (Seattle, Feb 2026)

**If considering external recruiter for pre-screening**:
- Typical rate: $34-250/hr (wide range)
- Quality technical recruiters: $75-150/hr
- 20-hour engagement: $1,500-3,000
- Turnaround: 5-day hiring sprints possible *only with pre-screened candidate pool* (sourcing takes time)

**Effectiveness data**:
- Cold email response: 4.1% (need 150 emails to get 6 interviews)
- LinkedIn warm outreach: 21-34% response (need 18-28 people to get 6 interviews)
- Implication: Warm pipeline is 5-8x more efficient than cold sourcing

---

## 2. TALENT AVAILABILITY (Feb 2026)

**Java/Maven Engineers**:
- Market: High demand, moderate-tight supply
- Range: $114-170K
- Feb availability: Assume 60-70% available for accelerated hiring

**Data Scientists**:
- Market: Good supply (less competitive than backend engineers)
- Range: $57-169K
- Feb availability: Better than Java; easier to source

**Technical Writers** (contractor):
- Market: $25-150/hr (avg $41.71/hr)
- Advantage: Faster sourcing (freelance platforms have 24-48h access)
- Feb availability: High

---

## 3. FINANCE APPROVAL WORKFLOWS ($100-200K Budget)

**Typical mortgage company SLA**:
- If pre-budgeted: 1 day
- If new headcount: 3-5 days (needs approval cycle)
- CFO threshold: >$50K typically requires CFO approval
- Bottleneck risk: Headcount freeze policies (common Feb-March in financial services)

**Best practice**: Pre-align with FP&A on whether 4 FTE are already in budget.

---

## 4. JOB OFFER PSYCHOLOGY

**Optimal call timing**:
- Research shows: 12-1 PM calls have highest same-day acceptance
- Reason: Candidates have had morning to think, still responsive
- Best day: Tue-Thu (Mon hesitation, Fri weekend mindset)

**Negotiation dynamics** (Feb 2026 market):
- Candidates perceive higher risk of rejection than managers apply
- Result: Candidates avoid negotiating (lower comp increases)
- Exploding offers (24h deadline): Effective but risky (post-hire resentment)
- Better: 48-72h window, emphasize growth + autonomy over urgency

**Acceptance speed**:
- Average time to accept: 2 days (down from 2.8 in 2023)
- Same-day acceptance likelihood: 40-60% if offer is strong + written offer prepared

## 5. CASE STUDY PATTERNS: RAPID HIRING SPRINTS

**Success formula** (Volta Trucks: 50 hires in 50 days):
1. Pre-planning: Salaries + benefits pre-approved (days -2 to 0)
2. Team training: 48 hrs for hiring managers on process (days 1-2)
3. Sourcing: Days 3-10
4. Interviews: Days 11-40 (structured, feedback-driven)
5. Offers: Days 41-50

**Key success factors**:
- Pre-approval on all exceptions (roles, comp bands, start dates)
- 48-hour feedback SLA on candidates (enables fast decisions)
- Standardized interview process (interviewers aligned)
- Clear decision criteria (no extended deliberation)

**Failure modes** (common in rushed sprints):
1. Lack of upfront alignment (hiring teams disagree on role definition, extends interview by 3-5 days)
2. No pre-approval on exceptions (escalations delay offers by 2-3 days)
3. Decision fatigue (after 4+ offers in 2 days, quality drops)
4. Misaligned interviewer expectations (candidates set up to fail)

---

## 6. WHEN NOT TO RUSH (Basecamp/37signals philosophy)

**Alternative pattern**: "Hire slow, integrate fast"
- Typical cycle: 4-6 weeks (no compression)
- Quality: 95%+ long-term retention
- Culture: Selective, sustainable hiring

**Tradeoff with Phase 1**:
- 5-day sprint: Fast, medium-high quality, requires pre-flight validation
- 4-week sprint: Slow, high quality, lower urgency

**When 5-day sprint is appropriate**:
- Warm candidate pipeline exists (sourcing ≠ bottleneck)
- Finance approval path is clear (no process delays)
- Hiring team is aligned (no extended deliberation)
- Urgency is real (gate deadline, market window, etc.)

## HOW TO USE THIS DATA

**During Feb 10-14 execution**:
- If call timing feels rushed → Use 12-1 PM window (psychology research)
- If candidate negotiates → 48-72h window is standard; build it in
- If decision loop extends → Check for team misalignment (common failure mode)
- If hiring manager gets fatigued → That's normal after 3+ decisions; plan breaks

**If timeline slips**:
- 1-2 day slip is normal (market reality)
- If >3 days: Likely root cause is pre-flight blocker (warm pipeline, team alignment, or finance)
- Fix: Escalate + validate (don't try to compress further)
