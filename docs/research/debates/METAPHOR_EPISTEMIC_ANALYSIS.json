    "summary": "Samstraumr employs metaphors with high epistemic value. They function as COGNITIVE TOOLS that generate useful designs and test strategies. One metaphor (consciousness) overextends from tool to claim, creating risk of metaphor capture. This is remediable through terminology refactoring.",
    "key_insight": "The distinction between using a metaphor to THINK about design (tool) vs. using a metaphor to CLAIM something is true about the system (claim) is crucial. Samstraumr does the former well. It partially fails at the latter distinction by conflating observation logging with consciousness.",
    "path_forward": "Rename consciousness-related terminology. Preserve the excellent logging and observation infrastructure. Separate consciousness research from engineering project."
