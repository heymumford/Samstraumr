# Architecture Test Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of implementing comprehensive architecture tests for the Samstraumr project based on the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Test Implementation Status

### Fixed Tests
- **ComponentBasedArchitectureTest**: Updated to work with the current domain model
  - Fixed to use the proper Component API (e.g., `terminate()` instead of `destroy()`)
  - Updated Composite handling to use named components
  - Updated Machine implementation to use Composites
  - Fixed event testing approach
  - Fixed property/dependency injection testing

### Tests in Progress
- **EventDrivenCommunicationTest**: Needs updates to match current event dispatcher implementation
- **HierarchicalIdentitySystemTest**: Needs updates to match current component identity implementation

### Maven Configuration

- Fixed Maven Surefire plugin configuration by removing the outdated JUnit platform provider
- Added JVM options to allow Java 21 reflection access
- Currently facing issues with Maven test execution - tests are being skipped despite configuration

## Next Steps

1. Fix EventDrivenCommunicationTest to properly use the current EventDispatcher implementation
2. Update HierarchicalIdentitySystemTest to properly use the ComponentId and ComponentHierarchy classes
3. Fix Maven test execution to ensure tests run properly
4. Implement AcyclicDependencyTest to prevent circular dependencies

## Build and Test Commands

We've found that the most reliable way to test individual test classes is by compiling them directly:

```bash
# Compile a specific test file
javac -d target/test-classes -cp target/classes:target/test-classes:$(mvn dependency:build-classpath -q -DincludeScope=test -Dmdep.outputFile=/dev/stdout) src/test/java/org/s8r/architecture/ComponentBasedArchitectureTest.java
```

For running Maven tests, we need to investigate why the following command isn't running tests:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest="org.s8r.architecture.ComponentBasedArchitectureTest" -DskipTests=false -pl Samstraumr/samstraumr-core
```
