## Architecture Overview

Samstraumr is built on Clean Architecture principles as defined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). The architecture is organized into concentric layers with dependencies pointing inward, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making the system more maintainable and testable.

### Architectural Layers

1. **Domain Layer** - The innermost layer that contains business entities, value objects, and domain logic.
2. **Application Layer** - Contains application-specific business rules, use cases, and ports (interfaces) for external services.
3. **Infrastructure Layer** - Implements the interfaces defined in the application layer, providing concrete implementations for external services.
4. **Presentation Layer** - Handles user interactions, whether through CLI, GUI, or API endpoints.

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies only point inward. Inner layers know nothing about outer layers.
- **Domain-Centered**: The domain model is at the core, immune to external changes.
- **Use Case-Driven**: Application behavior is defined by use cases.
- **Interface Adapters**: External systems are accessed through adapters implementing domain-defined ports.
- **Frameworks Independence**: The core logic doesn't depend on frameworks or libraries.

## Implementation Status

The Samstraumr framework has successfully implemented Clean Architecture:

1. ✅ Core component model implementation
2. ✅ Identity and lifecycle framework
3. ✅ Logging infrastructure
4. ✅ Component testing infrastructure
5. ✅ Composite pattern implementation
6. ✅ Machine abstractions
7. ✅ Clean Architecture implementation
8. ✅ Event-driven communication
9. ✅ Integration patterns (Transformer, Filter, Aggregator, Router)
10. ✅ Monitoring and management capabilities

## Key Design Patterns

Samstraumr employs several design patterns to achieve its architectural goals:

- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating complex objects (Components, Machines)
- **Observer Pattern**: Core of the event-driven architecture
- **Adapter Pattern**: Connects different parts of the system without creating direct dependencies
- **Composite Pattern**: Allows components to be composed into complex structures
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for pluggable behaviors
- **Decorator Pattern**: Used for component wrappers like monitoring
- **Command Pattern**: Used in event processing
