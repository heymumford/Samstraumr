# 13. Implement Comprehensive Validation System

Date: 2025-04-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Samstraumr framework evolves, we've identified that validation of components, connections, and machine operations is critical to maintaining system integrity and providing clear error feedback. Previous implementations lacked comprehensive validation in several key areas:

1. **Component References**: The system could reference non-existent components
2. **Component Types**: Components of incorrect types could be added to machines
3. **Connection Cycles**: Circular references between components were possible
4. **State Transitions**: Invalid machine state transitions were not properly prevented

The lack of robust validation led to cascading failures, unclear error messages, and debugging challenges. This impacted developer experience when building with the framework and could lead to runtime errors in production.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive validation system with the following components:

1. **Specialized Validator Classes**:
   - ComponentNameValidator
   - ComponentReferenceValidator
   - ComponentTypeValidator
   - CompositeConnectionValidator
   - MachineComponentValidator
   - MachineStateValidator

2. **Specialized Exception Classes**:
   - InvalidComponentNameException
   - NonExistentComponentReferenceException
   - InvalidCompositeTypeException
   - ConnectionCycleException
   - InvalidMachineStateTransitionException

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Component creation methods will validate names and types
   - Machine operations will validate component references and types
   - Composite connections will validate both existence and prevent cycles
   - State transitions will validate allowed state changes

4. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Early validation to fail fast and provide clear feedback
   - Stateless utility classes for most validation logic
   - Integration with domain model for contextual validation

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved system integrity through comprehensive validation
- Clear, specific error messages that identify validation failures
- Prevention of invalid operations before they can impact the system
- Better developer experience with fast failure and clear error context
- Improved test coverage for boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Reduced debugging time when issues occur

### Negative

- Slight increase in code complexity with additional validator classes
- Additional validation logic in core operations may impact performance (marginally)
- New failure modes introduced by validation logic

### Mitigations

- Organize validators in a consistent package structure
- Use clean interfaces and documentation to clarify validation responsibilities
- Implement test cases to verify both positive and negative validation scenarios
- Structure exceptions to provide maximum context for debugging

## Implementation Plan

1. Create specialized validator utility classes for each validation concern
2. Develop specific exception types that provide detailed context
3. Modify core domain objects to use validators at appropriate points
4. Add comprehensive tests for all validation scenarios
5. Document validation approach in architecture documentation
