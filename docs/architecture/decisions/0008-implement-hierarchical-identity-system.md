# 8. Implement Hierarchical Identity System

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In the Samstraumr framework, components can be nested to create complex, hierarchical structures. As systems grow, this creates several challenges:

1. **Component Identification**: How to uniquely identify components in a potentially vast component tree
2. **Location Transparency**: How to reference components regardless of their position in the hierarchy
3. **Relative Addressing**: How to address components relative to other components
4. **Cross-Boundary References**: How to reference components across different composite boundaries
5. **Lifecycle Management**: How to track component relationships through construction and destruction
6. **Query Capabilities**: How to find components based on criteria rather than direct references

Traditional flat identification schemes (UUIDs, simple strings) don't adequately represent hierarchical relationships. While universal identifiers like UUIDs provide uniqueness, they don't encode structural information about component relationships.

## Decision

We will implement a hierarchical identity system for Samstraumr with the following key features:

### 1. Identity Structure

Each component will have a hierarchical identity consisting of:

- **Base Identity**: The local name or identifier within its parent scope
- **Path Identity**: The full path from the root component
- **Unique ID**: A globally unique identifier (UUID) associated with each component

### 2. Addressing Formats

The identity system will support multiple addressing formats:

```
// Absolute addressing from root
/root/parent/component

// Relative addressing from current context
../sibling/component
./local/component

// UUID-based direct addressing (for persistence)
uuid:6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8

// Named addressing (for well-known components)
name:systemLogger
```

### 3. Identity Resolution

The framework will provide a resolution mechanism to:

- Resolve relative addresses to absolute paths
- Translate between different address formats
- Handle component relocation and maintain references

### 4. Identity Querying

Support for querying components based on:

- Path patterns (e.g., `/system/*/logger`)
- Attribute matching (e.g., `type=processor`)
- Component capability (e.g., `implements=Serializable`)

### 5. Identity Persistence

Mechanisms for:

- Serializing component identities for persistence
- Resolving identity references after system restart
- Handling identity conflicts during deserialization

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Structural Clarity**: Component relationships are explicitly represented in their identities
2. **Navigation Simplicity**: Easier to navigate component trees with path-based addressing
3. **Lookup Flexibility**: Multiple ways to reference the same component based on context
4. **Query Capability**: Ability to find components based on patterns and criteria
5. **Persistence Support**: Identities can be persisted and restored with relationship information intact
6. **Debug Facilitation**: Clear component paths simplify debugging and logging

### Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Performance impact of path resolution in deep hierarchies
   - **Mitigation**: Identity caching and optimized path resolution algorithms

2. **Challenge**: Maintaining references when component hierarchies change
   - **Mitigation**: Identity change events and subscription mechanisms for updates

3. **Challenge**: Potential for long path strings in deep hierarchies
   - **Mitigation**: Support for shortened path representations and path aliases

4. **Challenge**: Correctly handling identity during serialization/deserialization
   - **Mitigation**: Clear serialization protocols and identity restoration procedures

5. **Challenge**: Learning curve for developers used to flat identity schemes
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples and best practices

The hierarchical identity system will provide a foundation for component addressing, discovery, and interaction in the Samstraumr framework, enabling more sophisticated compositional patterns and system structures.
