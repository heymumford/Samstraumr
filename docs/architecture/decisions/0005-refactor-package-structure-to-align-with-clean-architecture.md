# 5. Refactor Package Structure to Align with Clean Architecture

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Samstraumr project has grown organically, leading to a less structured organization of code. As the system grows in complexity, this organic growth has resulted in:

1. **Unclear Dependencies**: Difficulty enforcing the dependency rule where inner layers should not know about outer layers
2. **Package Mixing**: Business logic mixed with infrastructure concerns
3. **Naming Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent naming patterns across similar components
4. **Discovery Challenges**: Difficulty finding related code due to scattered implementations
5. **Onboarding Friction**: New developers struggle to understand the system architecture

The current organization doesn't clearly communicate the architectural intent of the system and makes it difficult to maintain proper separation of concerns.

Clean Architecture provides a clear model for organizing code to enforce separation of concerns and dependency rules, with domain at the center, surrounded by application, and then infrastructure and adapter layers at the outside.

## Decision

We will refactor the package structure to explicitly align with Clean Architecture principles, using the following structure:

```
org.s8r/
├── domain/             # Domain layer (business entities and logic)
│   ├── component/      # Component domain entities
│   ├── identity/       # Identity and addressing concerns
│   ├── lifecycle/      # Lifecycle state management
│   ├── event/          # Domain events
│   └── exception/      # Domain exceptions
├── application/        # Application layer (use cases)
│   ├── service/        # Application services
│   ├── port/           # Input/output ports (interfaces)
│   └── dto/            # Data transfer objects
├── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure layer (technical details)
│   ├── persistence/    # Repository implementations
│   ├── event/          # Event handling infrastructure
│   ├── logging/        # Logging implementation
│   └── config/         # System configuration
└── adapter/            # Adapters layer (integration points)
    ├── in/             # Input adapters (CLI, REST, etc.)
    └── out/            # Output adapters (repositories, external systems)
```

We will follow these principles:

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies can only point inward (domain ← application ← infrastructure/adapter)
2. **Domain Independence**: Domain layer must have no dependencies on other layers
3. **Contract Definition**: Application layer defines interfaces (ports) that infrastructure implements
4. **Clear Package Names**: Package names directly communicate architectural purpose
5. **Consistent File Naming**: File naming patterns consistent within each layer

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Clear Architecture Communication**: Package structure explicitly communicates architectural intent
2. **Dependency Enforcement**: Easier to enforce the dependency rule (dependencies only point inward)
3. **Simplified Onboarding**: New developers can more quickly understand the system structure
4. **Better Maintainability**: Related code is co-located, improving discoverability
5. **Testability**: Clean separation makes unit testing easier, particularly for domain logic
6. **Extensibility**: Clear extension points for new capabilities in appropriate layers

### Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Migration effort for existing code
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental approach, starting with the domain layer and moving outward

2. **Challenge**: Potential resistance from team members used to the old structure
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, pair programming, and architecture diagrams

3. **Challenge**: Risk of breaking existing functionality during restructuring
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring, incremental changes

4. **Challenge**: Learning curve for Clean Architecture concepts
   - **Mitigation**: Training sessions, shared reading materials, paired reviews

This refactoring will provide a solid foundation for future growth, making the system more maintainable, testable, and comprehensible.
