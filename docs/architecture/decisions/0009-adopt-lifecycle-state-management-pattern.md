# 0009 Adopt Lifecycle State Management Pattern

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Components in the Samstraumr framework go through various states during their existence, from creation to destruction. Without a formal lifecycle model, we've encountered several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Initialization**: Components may be used before they're properly initialized
2. **Resource Management Issues**: Unclear when resources should be acquired and released
3. **State-Dependent Method Calls**: Methods called when components are in inappropriate states
4. **Race Conditions**: Concurrency issues during component startup and shutdown
5. **Error Recovery Difficulties**: No clear path for recovering from initialization failures
6. **Testing Complexity**: Difficult to test components in specific lifecycle states

We need an explicit lifecycle model that:
- Defines clear states and valid transitions
- Enforces valid state-based operations
- Provides hooks for resource management
- Supports graceful failure handling
- Is consistent across all component types

## Decision

We will adopt a formal lifecycle state management pattern for all components in the Samstraumr framework with the following elements:

### 1. core lifecycle states

Every component will follow a standard state model:

```
                       +------------+
                       |            |
                       v            |
  Created -> Initializing -> Ready -> Stopping -> Destroyed
      ^          |            |         |
      |          v            |         |
      |     Initialization    |         |
      +------ Failed <--------+---------+
```

- **Created**: Basic construction completed, no resources acquired
- **Initializing**: In the process of acquiring resources and validating configuration
- **Ready**: Fully operational and ready to perform work
- **Stopping**: In the process of releasing resources
- **Destroyed**: All resources released, object ready for garbage collection
- **Initialization Failed**: Initialization failed, component in error state

### 2. state transition management

Transitions between states will be:

- **Explicit**: Through clearly defined lifecycle methods
- **Validated**: Ensuring only valid transitions are allowed
- **Observable**: Generating events on state changes
- **Atomic**: Avoiding partial state transitions

### 3. state-based operation validation

Component methods will:

- Declare required states for operation
- Validate current state before execution
- Fail gracefully for invalid state calls

### 4. implementation structure

```java
// Standard lifecycle interface
public interface LifecycleAware {
    void initialize();
    void start();
    void stop();
    void destroy();
    LifecycleState getState();
}

// State enum
public enum LifecycleState {
    CREATED,
    INITIALIZING,
    READY,
    STOPPING,
    DESTROYED,
    INITIALIZATION_FAILED
}
```

### 5. hierarchy coordination

For composite components:

- Parent initialization completed only after all children initialize
- Child components stopped before parent components
- Failure in child initialization propagates to parent

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Predictable Behavior**: Clear states and transitions make component behavior more predictable
2. **Proper Resource Management**: Explicit lifecycle hooks ensure resources are properly managed
3. **Error Handling Clarity**: Well-defined error states and recovery paths
4. **Testing Simplification**: Easier to test components in specific lifecycle states
5. **Safer Concurrency**: Reduced risk of race conditions with explicit state management
6. **Consistent Programming Model**: Uniform approach across all component types

### Challenges and mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Increased code complexity for simple components
   - **Mitigation**: Base classes and utilities to simplify implementation

2. **Challenge**: Potential for deadlocks in hierarchical initialization
   - **Mitigation**: Timeout mechanisms and deadlock detection

3. **Challenge**: Performance overhead of state validation
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable validation levels (strict for development, optimized for production)

4. **Challenge**: Learning curve for developers
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, examples, and templates

5. **Challenge**: Legacy code adaptation
   - **Mitigation**: Wrapper components and incremental migration strategy
