# 0001 Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Samstraumr project grows in complexity, we need a reliable way to document important architectural decisions. These decisions shape the direction of the project and provide context for understanding why certain technical choices were made. Without explicit documentation, the knowledge of why important decisions were made is often lost over time or becomes tribal knowledge known only to a few developers who were involved at the time.

Key challenges include:
1. New team members lack the context for past decisions
2. Current team members may forget the reasons for decisions made in the past
3. Future decisions need to be made with awareness of past decisions
4. Current documentation does not clearly separate architectural decisions from other forms of documentation
5. We need to track the evolution of architecture over time

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the Samstraumr project. Each ADR will:

1. Be a Markdown document in the `docs/architecture/decisions` directory
2. Follow a standard template with sections for context, decision, and consequences
3. Have a unique sequential number (e.g., 0001, 0002)
4. Be created using the `./bin/new-adr` script
5. Be indexed in the `README.md` file in the architecture decisions directory

The ADR process will be:
1. Propose a new ADR when a significant architectural decision is made
2. Discuss the ADR with the team
3. Modify the ADR as needed based on feedback
4. Once accepted, update the status to "Accepted"
5. If the decision is superseded later, update the status to "Superseded" and link to the new ADR

## Consequences

Positive consequences:
1. New team members will have better context for understanding architectural decisions
2. Decision-making process becomes more transparent
3. Future decisions will be made with better awareness of past decisions
4. Architectural knowledge is retained even as team members change
5. The evolution of architecture over time is clearly documented

Challenges and mitigations:
1. Additional effort required to create and maintain ADRs
   - Mitigation: Provide a script and template to make creation as simple as possible
2. Determining what constitutes a "significant" architectural decision
   - Mitigation: Provide guidelines and examples in the README
3. Ensuring ADRs are created at the appropriate time
   - Mitigation: Incorporate ADR creation into the architecture review process
