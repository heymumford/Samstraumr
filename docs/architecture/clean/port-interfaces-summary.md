# Port Interfaces Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the port interfaces implemented in the Samstraumr project following Clean Architecture principles.

## What Are Port Interfaces?

Port interfaces are a core concept in hexagonal architecture (also known as "ports and adapters" pattern) that allow the application core to remain independent from external concerns. They come in two types:

- **Primary (Driving) Ports**: Interfaces through which the outside world communicates with the application
- **Secondary (Driven) Ports**: Interfaces the application uses to communicate with external systems
