# S8r Strategy

This document outlines the high-level strategic goals and architectural principles for the S8r framework.

## Core Strategy

The S8r strategy focuses on three key pillars:

1. **Simplified Structure** - Replace complex, nested package hierarchies with a cleaner organization
2. **Component Model** - Implement a clean, biological-inspired component lifecycle
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Ensure robust testing of both positive and negative paths

## Architectural Principles

1. **Simplified structure**
   - Maximum 4 levels of package nesting
   - Clear naming conventions without redundancy
   - `org.s8r` as the root package
2. **Clear separation of concerns**
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Distinct modules for core, environment, identity, and logging
   - Well-defined interfaces between modules
3. **Biological model**
   - Lifecycle follows biological development patterns
   - Components go through clearly defined states
   - Natural metaphors for understanding system behavior
4. **Hierarchical design**
   - Components form parent-child relationships
   - Identity inheritance and lineage tracking
   - Hierarchical addressing for navigation
5. **Environment awareness**
   - Components adapt to their environment
   - Environmental context captured at creation
   - Runtime environment changes reflected in behavior
6. **Complete replacement approach**
   - New implementations fully replace legacy code
   - No adapters or compatibility layers
   - Clean transition rather than gradual migration

## Package Structure

```
org.s8r                         (← replaces org.samstraumr)
├── core                        (← core functionality)
│   ├── tube                    (← component implementation)
│   │   ├── impl               (← concrete implementations)
│   │   ├── identity           (← identity functionality)
│   │   └── logging            (← component logging)
│   ├── env                     (← environment abstraction)
│   ├── composite               (← composite implementation)
│   ├── machine                 (← machine implementation)
│   └── exception               (← centralized exceptions)
├── util                        (← common utilities)
└── test                        (← testing infrastructure)
    ├── annotation              (← annotations)
    ├── cucumber                (← cucumber infrastructure)
    └── runner                  (← test runners)
```

## Component Model

The core component model follows a biological-inspired lifecycle:

1. **Creation phases**
   - CONCEPTION → INITIALIZING → CONFIGURING → SPECIALIZING → DEVELOPING_FEATURES
2. **Operational phases**
   - READY → ACTIVE → WAITING → ADAPTING → TRANSFORMING
3. **Advanced phases**
   - STABLE → SPAWNING → DEGRADED → MAINTAINING
4. **Termination phases**
   - TERMINATING → TERMINATED → ARCHIVED

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach balances:

1. **Positive path validation** - Ensuring components work correctly under normal conditions
2. **Negative path robustness** - Verifying graceful handling of errors and edge cases
3. **Behavior-driven tests** - Using BDD to clearly specify expected behaviors
4. **Full lifecycle coverage** - Testing components through all lifecycle states
