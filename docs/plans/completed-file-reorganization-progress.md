# Completed File Reorganization Progress

This document tracks the progress of the file reorganization effort in the Samstraumr project.

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation organization

1. ✅ Created file organization standards in `docs/reference/standards/file-organization.md`
2. ✅ Moved compatibility files to `docs/compatibility/`
3. ✅ Moved quality documentation to `docs/contribution/quality-checks.md`
4. ✅ Moved reorganization planning documents to `docs/planning/`
5. ✅ Moved testing documentation to `docs/testing/`
6. ✅ Moved workflow documentation to `docs/contribution/`
7. ✅ Moved README draft to `docs/planning/`

### Utility scripts organization

1. ✅ Moved script files to `util/` directory with proper naming convention
2. ✅ Updated legacy scripts in root directory to point to new locations
3. ✅ Created redirects for all moved scripts to maintain backward compatibility

### Temporary files organization

1. ✅ Created `temp/` directory for temporary files
2. ✅ Moved temporary output files to `temp/`

## Pending Tasks

### Documentation cleanup

1. ⬜ Consolidate redundant documentation between `docs/`, `docs-new/`, and `docs-reorganized/`
2. ⬜ Update links in documentation to reflect new file locations
3. ⬜ Standardize documentation file naming to follow Java project conventions:
   - Use UPPER_CASE for standard project docs (README.md, LICENSE)
   - Use PascalCase for supporting docs (Contributing.md, UserGuide.md)
   - Use PascalCase for reference docs (CodeConventions.md, TestingStrategy.md)

### Code organization

1. ⬜ Review and possibly refactor the `src/` directory at root level
2. ⬜ Review and organize the `bin/` directory or remove if unused

### Build system

1. ⬜ Update Maven build scripts to point to new file locations
2. ⬜ Ensure CI/CD pipeline uses new script locations

## Implementation Summary

### Files reorganized

1. **Documentation Files**
   - `COMPATIBILITY_FIXES.md` → `docs/compatibility/COMPATIBILITY_FIXES.md`
   - `COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md` → `docs/compatibility/COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md`
   - `quality-checks-readme.md` → `docs/contribution/quality-checks.md`
   - `SCRIPT_REORGANIZATION.md` → `docs/planning/SCRIPT_REORGANIZATION.md`
   - `FOLDER_REFACTORING_PLAN.md` → `docs/planning/FOLDER_REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
   - `tmp-reorg-plan.md` → `docs/planning/tmp-reorg-plan.md`
   - `TEST_STANDARDIZATION.md` → `docs/testing/TEST_STANDARDIZATION.md`
   - `WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/contribution/WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md`
   - `README.md.new` → `docs/planning/README-NEW-DRAFT.md`
   - `Tube Components and Samstraumr Integration_ (1).docx` → `docs/proposals/`
2. **Script Files**
   - `map-test-type.sh` → `util/test-map-type.sh`
   - `run-tests.sh` → `util/test-run.sh`
   - `run-atl-tests.sh` → `util/test-run-atl.sh`
   - `setup-fast.sh` → `util/scripts/setup-fast-build.sh`
   - `update-java-headers.sh` → `util/scripts/update-java-headers.sh`
   - `update-md-headers.sh` → `util/scripts/update-md-headers.sh`
   - `update-version.sh` → `util/version.sh`
3. **Temporary Files**
   - `minimal_output.txt` → `temp/minimal_output.txt`
   - `tmpfile` → `temp/tmpfile`

### New files created

1. `docs/reference/standards/file-organization.md` - File organization standards
2. `docs/planning/FILE_REORGANIZATION_PROGRESS.md` - This progress report

## Next Steps

1. Remove all original files after verifying that copies work correctly
2. Update documentation references to point to new file locations
3. Consider removing the duplicate documentation directories after consolidation
4. Test all scripts to ensure they work from their new locations
5. Update CI/CD pipeline to use the new script locations

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Essential files only in root, improving navigability
2. **Logical Organization**: Files grouped by function and purpose
3. **Consistent Naming**: Function-based prefixes and kebab-case for all scripts
4. **Better Documentation**: Improved organization of documentation files
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy scripts redirect to new locations
