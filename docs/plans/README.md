# README

This directory contains all planning documents for the Samstraumr project, organized with clear naming conventions rather than nested directories.

## File Organization

Instead of using nested directories, we use file naming prefixes to indicate the status and type of each plan:

- `active-*.md` - Plans that are currently being implemented
- `completed-*.md` - Plans that have been fully implemented
- `archived-*.md` - Plans that are no longer relevant or have been superseded

## Key Documents

- [kanban.md](kanban.md) - Current work tracking board
- [work-tracking-guide.md](work-tracking-guide.md) - Guide to our work tracking process

## Related Directories

- [../architecture.md](../architecture.md) - Architecture documentation
- [../reference/standards.md](../reference/standards.md) - Coding and documentation standards
