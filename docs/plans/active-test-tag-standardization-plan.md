# Active Test Tag Standardization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for completing the standardization of test tags across the Samstraumr codebase. The goal is to make test execution more consistent, improve test organization, and facilitate better reporting and metrics.

## Progress Update (April 6, 2025)

- ✅ Created standardized test pyramid tag structure (L0_Unit, L1_Component, L2_Integration, L3_System)
- ✅ Created mapping documentation between legacy and new tags
- ✅ Developed standardization utility script with backup functionality
- ✅ Enhanced s8r-test to support both legacy and standardized tags
- ✅ Fixed standardization script to handle multi-line feature/scenario definitions
- ✅ Applied standardization to core component tests
- ✅ Applied standardization to key integration tests
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the current state

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Apply Standardization to All Feature Files** (2 days)
   - Run standardization across all feature files in the codebase
   - Focus on these directories in order:
     1. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/tube/features/L0_Tube`
     2. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/tube/features/L1_Bundle`
     3. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/tube/features/L1_Composite`
     4. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/tube/features/L2_Machine`
     5. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/tube/features/L3_System`
     6. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/composites/features`
     7. `Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/streamtest`

2. **Validate Test Functionality** (1 day)
   - Run complete test suite with the new tags
   - Verify that all tests still run correctly
   - Ensure test coverage remains consistent
   - Fix any issues with test selection or execution

3. **Update CI/CD Configuration** (1/2 day)
   - Modify CI/CD pipelines to use standardized tags
   - Update test reports to reflect the new tag structure
   - Ensure proper test selection in automated workflows

4. **Update Developer Documentation** (1/2 day)
   - Create guide for writing tests with the new tag structure
   - Update examples in documentation to use standardized tags
   - Add section to the developer guide about the test pyramid

5. **Finalize Transition** (1/2 day)
   - Mark test tag standardization as complete in KANBAN
   - Update README.md with information about standardized testing
   - Schedule obsolescence of legacy tags (3 months from completion)

## Implementation Approach

1. Use the standardize-test-tags.sh script to batch process files
2. Manually review changes to ensure correctness
3. Run tests after each directory to verify functionality
4. If issues arise, restore from backups and fix incrementally

## Success Criteria

1. All feature files use standardized tags
2. Tests can be executed using the standardized tag structure
3. Legacy tags continue to work for backward compatibility
4. CI/CD pipelines run tests with the new structure
5. Test coverage is maintained or improved

## Timeline

- Start: April 6, 2025
- Estimated Completion: April 10, 2025
