# Compatibility Fixes for Bundle to Composite Transition

This document summarizes the changes made to support the transition from the legacy `Bundle` architecture to the new `Composite` architecture.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Bundle Compatibility Layer**
   - Updated `Bundle.java` to properly delegate to `Composite`
   - Implemented `Bundle.BundleEvent` and `Bundle.CircuitBreaker` adapter classes
   - Fixed `BundleFactory` to properly create instances with delegation to `CompositeFactory`

2. **Test Framework Compatibility**
   - Added PostgreSQL TestContainers dependency to support `StreamTest`
   - Fixed imports in test files for annotations
   - Enhanced `RunTests.java` to map between industry-standard and Samstraumr-specific terminology
   - Fixed `RunATLCucumberTest.java` to support both JUnit and Cucumber-based ATL tests

3. **Type Compatibility Issues**
   - Fixed `StreamTest.java` to use the fully qualified `org.samstraumr.tube.composite.Composite.CircuitBreaker` type
   - Fixed `PatternSteps.java` to address `Bundle.BundleEvent` inconsistencies

4. **Documentation**
   - Created a README.md in the bundle package explaining the compatibility approach
   - Created a run-atl-tests.sh script to simplify running ATL tests
   - Documented the compatibility layer and migration path

## Testing

To run ATL tests, use the provided script:

```bash
./run-atl-tests.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Begin migrating from `Bundle` to `Composite` in application code
2. Update remaining test files to use `Composite` instead of `Bundle`
3. Consider adding deprecation warnings to encourage migration
4. Plan for complete removal of `Bundle` in a future release
