# Compatibility Report

## Summary

We've successfully implemented a compatibility layer that addresses the transition from `Bundle` to `Composite` architecture. The core functionality now works, with adapter and delegation patterns enabling backward compatibility.

## Implemented Features

1. **Bundle Delegation to Composite**
   - Bundle.java now acts as a wrapper around Composite
   - All public methods delegate to corresponding Composite methods
   - Legacy methods are properly annotated with @Deprecated

2. **BundleFactory Delegation**
   - BundleFactory methods now create proper Bundle instances
   - Each method delegates to the corresponding CompositeFactory method
   - Appropriate deprecation warnings are emitted

3. **Type Compatibility Classes**
   - Added Bundle.BundleEvent adapter for Composite.CompositeEvent
   - Added Bundle.CircuitBreaker adapter for Composite.CircuitBreaker
   - Created appropriate conversion methods for collections of these types

4. **Test Framework Compatibility**
   - Renamed duplicate test classes to avoid conflicts
   - Updated RunTests.java to support both industry-standard and Samstraumr-specific terminology
   - Fixed imports to use correct annotation packages
   - Added compatibility annotations in test runners

5. **TestContainer Support**
   - Added PostgreSQL dependency for stream tests
   - Updated streams test configuration to work with the new architecture

## Verification

Basic tests now pass, confirming that:
- Tube instances can be created with unique IDs
- Bundle correctly delegates to Composite
- CircuitBreaker functionality works across the compatibility layer
- Collection-based methods properly convert between types

## Remaining Issues

1. **Cucumber Test Framework**
   - The Cucumber test framework still needs configuration to correctly find feature files
   - Test resources may need updates to support specific test needs

2. **Maven Profile Configuration**
   - The atl-tests profile needs configuration to execute tests
   - Test skipping flags need investigation

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Full integration tests with BDD scenarios need to be validated
   - System boundaries tests may require additional configuration

## Next Steps

1. Focus on getting Cucumber tests running properly
2. Configure Maven profiles for effective test execution
3. Complete validation of all core functionality
4. Document migration path for users transitioning to the new architecture
