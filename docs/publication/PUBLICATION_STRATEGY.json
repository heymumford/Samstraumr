Paper 1 is the blockbuster that establishes the framework; Papers 2-5 are specialized domain explorations. Reading them in sequence (1→2→3→4→5) tells the story: theory reveals why biological systems work, architecture shows how to build them, observation shows what they can do, patterns show how they mature, consciousness shows what they are.",
      "ecosystem_thinking": "Each paper contributes to a larger ecosystem: Samstraumr becomes the canonical implementation of: (1) systems theory in software, (2) executable architecture specifications, (3) consciousness-aware systems, (4) lifecycle patterns, (5) computational consciousness. Papers reinforce each other; citing one suggests citing all."
