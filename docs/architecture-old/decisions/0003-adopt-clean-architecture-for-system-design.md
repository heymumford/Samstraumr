# 3. Adopt Clean Architecture for system design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Samstraumr project has grown, we've encountered several challenges with traditional layered architectures:

1. **Tight coupling**: Changes in one layer often necessitate changes in many others.
2. **Dependency issues**: External systems and libraries dictate our domain model design.
3. **Testing difficulties**: Components are hard to test in isolation due to dependencies.
4. **Domain logic fragmentation**: Business rules are scattered across different layers.
5. **Framework dependency**: Core business logic becomes tied to specific frameworks and tools.
6. **Evolving requirements**: Difficulty adapting to changing requirements without major refactoring.

These issues make it harder to maintain, test, and evolve the system over time. We need an architectural approach that:

- Focuses on the domain rather than technical concerns
- Makes the system more testable
- Reduces coupling between components
- Makes dependencies explicit and controlled
- Allows us to evolve the system as requirements change
- Provides clear boundaries and responsibilities

## Decision

We will adopt Clean Architecture principles for the Samstraumr system design. Clean Architecture, as described by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), organizes code into concentric circles representing different layers of the system, with dependencies pointing inward toward the center.

The key principles we will follow:

1. **Independence of frameworks**: The architecture does not depend on the existence of specific libraries or frameworks. These are tools, not architectural constraints.

2. **Testability**: Business rules can be tested without UI, database, web server, or any external element.

3. **Independence of UI**: The UI can change without changing the rest of the system.

4. **Independence of database**: Business rules are not bound to a specific database implementation.

5. **Independence of external agencies**: Business rules don't know anything about interfaces to the outside world.

Our architecture will have these layers (from innermost to outermost):

- **Entities**: Core business objects representing the key concepts in our domain.
- **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules that orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities.
- **Interface Adapters**: Adapters that convert data between the use cases and external systems.
- **Frameworks & Drivers**: External systems, tools, and delivery mechanisms.

The key rule is that dependencies always point inward. Inner layers cannot know about outer layers, while outer layers can know about inner layers.

## Consequences

Positive consequences:

1. **Improved testability**: Business rules can be tested without external dependencies.
2. **Flexibility**: We can switch frameworks, databases, and external systems with minimal impact on the core business logic.
3. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make the system easier to understand and maintain.
4. **Domain focus**: The domain model becomes the center of the design, not an afterthought.
5. **Adaptability**: The system can evolve more easily as requirements change.
6. **Independence**: The system is not tied to specific frameworks or external systems.

Challenges and mitigations:

1. **Learning curve**: Clean Architecture requires a shift in thinking for developers accustomed to traditional layered architectures.
   - Mitigation: Provide documentation and training on Clean Architecture principles.

2. **Increased boilerplate**: More interfaces and adapter classes may be needed.
   - Mitigation: Use code generation where appropriate and focus on the benefits of decoupling.

3. **Performance concerns**: Additional abstraction layers might impact performance.
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize where necessary, understanding that in most cases, the performance impact is negligible.

4. **Integration with existing code**: Not all existing code follows Clean Architecture principles.
   - Mitigation: Gradual refactoring, starting with new features and critical components.

## Implementation

The implementation will follow this approach:

1. Define clear domain entities in the inner core, free from framework dependencies.
2. Implement use cases that define the application's business rules.
3. Define interfaces (ports) for external systems in the inner layers.
4. Implement adapters for these interfaces in the outer layers.
5. Connect everything using dependency injection to maintain the dependency rule.
6. Use a consistent package structure that reflects the architectural layers.

The implementation will be verified through comprehensive tests at all levels, from unit tests of the inner layers to integration tests of the complete system.
