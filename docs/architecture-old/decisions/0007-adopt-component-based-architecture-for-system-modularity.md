# 7. Adopt Component-Based Architecture for System Modularity

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Samstraumr aims to support flexible, scalable, and modular system construction. Traditional monolithic approaches or purely microservice-based systems each have limitations that don't align with our core objectives:

1. **Monolithic approaches**: Difficult to scale, hard to maintain independence of subsystems, and challenging to evolve incrementally
2. **Pure microservices**: Introduce distributed computing complexity, require extensive DevOps investment, and may result in excessive fragmentation

We need an architectural approach that:
- Supports strong modularity and encapsulation
- Enables compositional design (building larger structures from smaller ones)
- Provides clear boundaries and contracts between subsystems
- Allows for flexible deployment options (monolithic, distributed, or hybrid)
- Facilitates evolution at different rates for different system parts

The concept of components - self-contained units with well-defined interfaces and dependencies - provides a promising foundation for our architectural approach.

## Decision

We will adopt a component-based architecture as the core structural pattern for Samstraumr, with the following key elements:

### 1. Core Component Model

- **Basic Component**: Self-contained unit with well-defined interfaces
- **Component Lifecycle**: Standard lifecycle stages (creation, initialization, running, shutdown)
- **Identity Concept**: Hierarchical addressing scheme for component identification
- **State Management**: Explicit state modeling and transition rules

### 2. Compositional Patterns

- **Composite Components**: Components that contain and manage child components
- **Machine Concept**: Special composite components that orchestrate data flow
- **Connection Model**: Explicit connections between component interfaces
- **Hierarchical Composition**: Support for multilevel nesting

### 3. Interface Contracts

- **Input/Output Ports**: Clear definition of interaction points
- **Event-Based Communication**: Standard patterns for event publishing and subscription
- **Data Flow Contracts**: Explicit data transformation and validation rules
- **Dependency Injection**: Clear mechanism for providing dependencies

### 4. Implementation Guidelines

- **Separation of Interface and Implementation**: Interfaces defined separately from implementations
- **Factory Pattern**: Standard component creation patterns
- **Testing Support**: Component mocking and testing utilities
- **Configuration Model**: Standardized approach to component configuration

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Modular Design**: Clearer system boundaries leading to better maintainability
2. **Flexible Deployment**: Components can be deployed together or separately as needed
3. **Independent Evolution**: Components can evolve at different rates
4. **Reusability**: Well-defined components can be reused across projects
5. **Testing Simplification**: Components with clear boundaries are easier to test in isolation
6. **Scalability Options**: Different scaling strategies for different components
7. **Simplified Reasoning**: Easier to understand system behavior through component composition

### Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Overhead of component boundaries in simple scenarios
   - **Mitigation**: Lightweight component implementation options for simpler cases

2. **Challenge**: Learning curve for component-based design
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, patterns library, and developer guidance

3. **Challenge**: Risk of over-fragmentation into too many small components
   - **Mitigation**: Design guidelines for appropriate component granularity

4. **Challenge**: Performance impact of component boundaries
   - **Mitigation**: Optimization strategies and performance testing

5. **Challenge**: Complexity of dependency management between components
   - **Mitigation**: Dependency injection framework and component lifecycle management

This architectural approach aligns with industry best practices around modularity while providing the specific features needed for Samstraumr's domain. It provides a middle ground between monolithic and microservice architectures, allowing for flexible deployment models that can evolve over time.
