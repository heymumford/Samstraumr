# 0010 Implement Event Driven Communication Model

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Samstraumr framework needs an effective communication mechanism between components that supports:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Components should be able to interact without direct dependencies
2. **Scalability**: Communication should work efficiently at both small and large scales
3. **Flexibility**: Support for various communication patterns (pub-sub, point-to-point, broadcast)
4. **Observability**: Ability to monitor, trace, and debug communication
5. **Resilience**: Communication should be resilient to component failures
6. **Cross-boundary Communication**: Support for communication across component boundaries

Traditional direct method calls create tight coupling between components, making them harder to test, evolve, and recompose. Meanwhile, purely synchronous communication can lead to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.

## Decision

We will implement an event-driven communication model as the primary mechanism for component interactions in the Samstraumr framework with the following key elements:

### 1. core event model

- **Domain Events**: Immutable records of significant occurrences in the system
- **Event Publishers**: Components that generate and publish events
- **Event Handlers**: Components that subscribe to and process events
- **Event Dispatcher**: Infrastructure component that routes events from publishers to handlers

### 2. event types and hierarchy

We'll define a standardized event hierarchy:

```
DomainEvent (base)
├── ComponentEvent
│   ├── ComponentCreatedEvent
│   ├── ComponentStateChangedEvent
│   └── ComponentDataEvent
├── MachineEvent
│   ├── MachineStateChangedEvent
│   └── MachineConfigurationEvent
└── SystemEvent
    ├── SystemStartupEvent
    ├── SystemShutdownEvent
    └── SystemErrorEvent
```

### 3. subscription mechanisms

Support for multiple subscription patterns:

- **Direct subscription**: Component explicitly subscribes to specific event types
- **Pattern-based subscription**: Subscription based on event attribute patterns
- **Hierarchical subscription**: Subscription to events from specific component subtrees
- **Positional subscription**: Automatic subscription based on component position in data flow

### 4. delivery guarantees

Different delivery options based on use case:

- **At-most-once**: Basic fire-and-forget delivery
- **At-least-once**: Persistent delivery with retry mechanisms
- **Exactly-once**: Exactly-once delivery semantics for critical operations
- **Ordered delivery**: Guaranteed order of events for specific publishers or event types

### 5. implementation approach

```java
// Core event interface
public interface DomainEvent {
    String getEventId();
    ComponentId getSourceId();
    Instant getTimestamp();
    String getEventType();
    Map<String, Object> getPayload();
}

// Event dispatcher interface
public interface EventDispatcher {
    void publish(DomainEvent event);
    void subscribe(EventHandler handler, String... eventTypes);
    void unsubscribe(EventHandler handler);
}

// Event handler interface
public interface EventHandler {
    void handleEvent(DomainEvent event);
    String[] getHandledEventTypes();
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Decoupling**: Components can interact without direct dependencies
2. **Extensibility**: New event publishers and handlers can be added without modifying existing code
3. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock events
4. **Flexibility**: Support for various communication patterns and topologies
5. **Scalability**: Event distribution can be optimized for different scales
6. **Observability**: Event flows can be monitored, traced, and analyzed
7. **Resilience**: Failure in one component doesn't directly impact others

### Challenges and mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Increased complexity compared to direct method calls
   - **Mitigation**: Clear event design guidelines and consistent patterns

2. **Challenge**: Potential difficulty in debugging event flows
   - **Mitigation**: Event tracing tools and visualization utilities

3. **Challenge**: Performance overhead for simple interactions
   - **Mitigation**: Optimization for local event delivery and direct handler invocation

4. **Challenge**: Ensuring event consistency and delivery guarantees
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable delivery options and transactional event patterns

5. **Challenge**: Learning curve for developers
   - **Mitigation**: Documentation, examples, and best practice guides
