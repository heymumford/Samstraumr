# 0004 Test Architecture Documentation Generation

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Architecture documentation is critical for maintaining long-term understanding and coherence of a software system. In the Samstraumr project, we have incorporated automated generation of C4 model diagrams and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document the system architecture (see ADR-0002 and ADR-0003).

However, without verification, these documentation tools might:
1. Break silently over time due to changes in dependencies or system structure
2. Become out of sync with the actual implementation
3. Be forgotten or unused by development teams when making architectural changes

Just like other critical parts of our system, architecture documentation tools should be tested to ensure they remain functional and useful.

## Decision

We will create automated tests that verify:

1. The functionality of our architecture documentation generation tools, including:
   - C4 diagram generation scripts
   - Architecture Decision Record (ADR) creation and management scripts

2. The integration of these tools with our build and CI/CD processes

3. The consistency of our architecture documentation with our actual system implementation

Specifically, we will implement the following tests:
- JUnit-based automated tests that verify both tools operate correctly
- Integration tests that verify diagram generation during the build process
- Tests that validate the structure and content of ADRs
- A Maven profile (`architecture-tests`) dedicated to running these tests

All architecture documentation tests will be tagged with the `architecture` tag for easy identification and execution.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Early detection of issues with documentation tools
- Increased visibility of architecture documentation in the development process
- Encourage a culture of maintaining up-to-date architecture documentation
- Documentation becomes a first-class citizen in the development process, tested like any other component
- Reduced risk of divergence between documented architecture and actual implementation

### Challenges and mitigations
- **Challenge**: Tests for documentation tools may increase build time
  - **Mitigation**: Architecture tests will be in a separate Maven profile so they don't run on every build

- **Challenge**: Environment-dependent tools (like Python for diagrams) may cause test failures in some environments
  - **Mitigation**: Tests are designed to degrade gracefully when dependencies are missing

- **Challenge**: Tests may become brittle if tied too closely to specific documentation content
  - **Mitigation**: Tests focus on structure and existence of documentation rather than exact content

- **Challenge**: Additional maintenance burden for documentation tests
  - **Mitigation**: The value of reliable architecture documentation outweighs the cost of maintaining these tests
