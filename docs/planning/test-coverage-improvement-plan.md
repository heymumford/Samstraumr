# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to increase Samstraumr's test coverage to 80% across all layers of the application, with proportional increases in other test pyramid levels.

## Current Status

Based on our test coverage analysis, we currently have:

- **Test Files**: 56 Java test files and 58 BDD feature files
- **Coverage Gaps**: Significant gaps in domain, application, infrastructure, adapter, and integration tests
- **Current Coverage Target**: 75% line and branch coverage (not yet achieved)
- **Desired Coverage Target**: 80% line and branch coverage

## Test Pyramid Target Distribution

To achieve a balanced, comprehensive test coverage, we'll aim for the following distribution:

| Test Type | Current Count | Target Count | Description |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Unit/Domain Tests** | 4 | 20 | Small, focused tests of domain logic |
| **Application Tests** | 10 | 25 | Service and use case tests |
| **Infrastructure Tests** | 10 | 25 | External adapter implementation tests |
| **Adapter Tests** | 11 | 22 | Clean architecture boundary tests |
| **Integration Tests** | 4 | 15 | Component interaction tests |
| **System Tests** | 6 | 10 | End-to-end workflow tests |

## Coverage Metrics Targets

In addition to increasing test counts, we'll establish these specific coverage metrics targets:

| Metric | Current Target | New Target |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Line Coverage | 75% | 80% |
| Branch Coverage | 75% | 80% |
| Method Coverage | N/A | 85% |
| Class Coverage | N/A | 90% |

## Implementation Strategies

### Test-First Approach

1. **Feature Branch Testing**
   - Require tests for all new features
   - Enforce coverage thresholds on feature branches
   - Make test coverage part of code review

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Implement TDD for all new components
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Refactor existing code using test-first approach

### Mocking Strategy

1. **Mock External Dependencies**
   - Use Mockito for external dependencies
   - Create specialized mocks for complex interactions
   - Implement test doubles for boundary interfaces

2. **Test Data Strategy**
   - Create reusable test data factories
   - Use builder pattern for test objects
   - Implement property-based testing for complex domains

### Quality Assurance Practices

1. **Code Review Practices**
   - Verify test coverage in code reviews
   - Review test quality, not just quantity
   - Check boundary cases and error scenarios

2. **Mutation Testing**
   - Introduce PIT mutation testing
   - Validate effectiveness of tests
   - Target 80% mutation testing score

## Monitoring and Reporting

1. **CI Integration**
   - Integrate coverage reports with CI pipeline
   - Track coverage trends over time
   - Alert on coverage decreases

2. **Developer Tools**
   - Create IDE integrations for coverage visualization
   - Provide clear coverage feedback during development
   - Implement pre-commit hooks for test validation

## Resource Allocation

1. **Dedicated Resources**
   - Assign 2 developers focused on test infrastructure
   - All feature teams allocate 20% time to test coverage
   - Weekly test coverage review sessions

2. **Training and Support**
   - Provide TDD training for all developers
   - Create comprehensive testing guidelines
   - Establish test pairing sessions

## Success Metrics

| False sense of security | High | Low | Include mutation testing |

## Approval and Review

This test coverage improvement plan will be reviewed monthly, with adjustments made based on progress and emerging priorities. Success will be measured by the achievement of the outlined coverage metrics and the improvement in code quality and developer confidence.
