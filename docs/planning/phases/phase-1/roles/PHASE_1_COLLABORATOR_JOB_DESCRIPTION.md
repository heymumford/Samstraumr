# Job Description: Collaborator (Experimentalist)

## Position Overview
Full-time research collaborator supporting a 20-week software architecture and consciousness research initiative. Focus: experimental design, data analysis, chaos engineering, and empirical validation of self-healing system claims.

---

## Role: Experimentalist

### Primary Responsibilities

**Research Design & Execution** (40%):
- Design and execute 3 critical experiments (Weeks 9-15):
  - Single-point failure recovery validation (Gate 4 decision point, Week 15)
  - Cascade prevention mechanisms
  - Event queue semantics
- Collaborate with philosophy expert on consciousness formalization falsifiability
- Conduct cognitive load A/B test (Weeks 6-8, Gate 2 decision point)

**Measurement & Instrumentation** (30%):
- Design and implement state transition coverage measurement
- Develop performance benchmarks (JMH-based)
- Instrument system for chaos engineering (failure injection)
- Measure cognitive load via NASA-TLX and task completion metrics
- Collect and analyze experimental data (statistical rigor, effect sizes)

**Data Analysis & Synthesis** (20%):
- Statistical analysis of experiment results (R/Python)
- Prepare empirical validation datasets for papers
- Create visualizations for publication (figures, tables, graphs)
- Document reproducibility (code + data archive)

**Team Collaboration** (10%):
- Weekly sync meetings (Mondays, 10 AM PT)
- Unblock architecture work (Rank 36 ConsciousnessLoggerAdapter)
- Prepare briefings for 5 critical gates (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 15, 20)

## Required Qualifications

### Must Have
- **Data Science / Statistics**: 5+ years experience designing experiments, conducting statistical tests
- **Programming**: Proficiency in Python or R (data analysis, statistical modeling)
- **Empirical Research**: Experience with A/B testing, hypothesis validation, effect size measurement
- **Technical Communication**: Can explain statistical findings to non-statisticians
- **Self-Directed**: Minimal supervision needed; proactive problem-solving

### Nice to Have
- Experience with chaos engineering (fault injection, resilience testing)
- Background in software architecture or systems theory
- Familiarity with Java/Maven build systems
- Published research or thesis work

### Personality Fit
- Patient with philosophical ambiguity (consciousness is contested)
- Comfortable with high-risk experiments (recovery might fail)
- Detail-oriented (empirical rigor required)
- Collaborative (weekly sync + gate reviews)

---

## Compensation & Timeline

- **Salary**: $3,000/week × 20 weeks = **$60,000 total**
- **Start Date**: Monday, Feb 17, 2026 (Week 1 kickoff)
- **End Date**: Friday, June 26, 2026 (Week 20 completion)
- **Location**: Remote (sync with Eric Mumford, Guild Mortgage HQ Seattle timezone)
- **Hours**: 40 hours/week (included in $3,000/week)

---

## Critical Success Factors

**Gate 4 (Week 15) — EXISTENTIAL DECISION POINT**:
- Recovery rate ≥70% → "Self-Healing Architectures" narrative (publish as-is)
- Recovery rate <70% → "Recovery-Enabling Architectures" narrative (reframe, still publishable)
- **Your responsibility**: Conduct rigorous recovery testing, provide honest data

**Timeline Pressure**:
- Week 1-5: Foundation (define measurement, design experiments)
- Week 6-12: Measurement phase (run A/B test, baseline metrics)
- Week 10-15: Critical experiments (recovery validation — highest risk)
- Week 16-20: Publication push (prepare empirical papers)
