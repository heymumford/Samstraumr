## CONTINGENCIES & BLOCKERS

### If Collaborator offer rejected:
- [ ] Activate backup candidate immediately (Feb 13, 5 PM)
- [ ] Update timeline: Start date Feb 24 instead of Feb 17 (1-week delay)
- [ ] Communicate impact to Gates 1-4 (cascading timeline adjustment)
- [ ] Cascade work to contractors (Phase 2 infrastructure takes on more responsibility)

### If Contractor 1 unavailable:
- [ ] Use backup tooling engineer (standby list)
- [ ] Risk: Smart linter delays to Week 6-12 (impact on code quality gates)
- [ ] Mitigation: Eric implements manually if needed (adds 20h to Eric's load)

### If Contractor 2 (Writer) unavailable:
- [ ] Use backup technical writer (standby list)
- [ ] Risk: Paper drafting delays, deadline pressure Weeks 16-20
- [ ] Mitigation: Eric drafts outlines; contractor polishes (shared work)

### If Contractor 3 (Data Sci) unavailable:
- [ ] Statistical analysis deferred to Eric + Collaborator
- [ ] Risk: Quality of statistical rigor in papers
- [ ] Mitigation: Collaborator has data science background; can handle basic analysis

### If Finance approval delayed past Feb 10:
- [ ] CANNOT proceed with hiring
- [ ] Escalate to Executive Sponsor (whoever has budget authority)
- [ ] Decision: Delay Week 1 start by 1 week? (impacts all gates)

## NOTES FOR ERIC

**Feb 10 Preparation**:
- Gather candidate contacts before Feb 10 start
- Draft personalized recruitment emails (templates ready)
- Know your "yes/no" criteria before phone screens (avoid analysis paralysis)

**Phone Screen Tips**:
- Use scorecard during call (3 min notes per question)
- Don't make offer in same call; take 24h to decide
- Trust your gut on "culture fit" (can they handle ambiguity?)

**Contracting Tips**:
- Contractors are scared of vague scopes → be crystal clear on deliverables
- Payment terms matter more than total fee → offer Net 15 (reasonable)
- Get W-9s back before first invoice (required for 1099)

**Timeline Pressure**:
- You're hiring on Feb 13 for Feb 17 start → aggressive but doable
- If blocked, don't delay kickoff; adjust scope instead
- Week 1 kickoff cannot move (cascades all gates)

**Red Flags**:
- Candidate says "I'll need 2 weeks to onboard" → Not acceptable (need immediate productivity)
- Contractor hedges on availability → Pass (you need commitment)
- Finance doesn't approve by Feb 10 → Escalate immediately
