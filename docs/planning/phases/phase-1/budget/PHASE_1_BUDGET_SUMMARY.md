## BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS

✅ **What's Included**:
- Two full-time salaries (20 weeks)
- Three contractor engagements
- IT infrastructure (existing)

---

## RISK: NO CONTINGENCY BUFFER

**Current Budget**: $156,100 (zero contingency)

**Risks**:
1. **Contractor unavailability**: If Contractor 1-3 unable to perform, no replacement budget
   - Mitigation: Backup contractors identified; cascade work to existing team if needed

2. **Scope creep**: Additional research priorities might emerge (Ranks 21-25)
   - Mitigation: Strict scope freeze; defer to Phase 2 (Year 2)

3. **FTE hire delays**: If Collaborator not hired by Feb 13, start date slips
   - Mitigation: Activate backup plan (extend timeline 1 week, cascade to contractors)

4. **Publication costs**: Likely $2-5K in open-access fees
   - Mitigation: Apply for author funds, seek sponsorship from Guild

## COST-SAVING OPPORTUNITIES (Deferred)

If budget cuts required, defer:
- [ ] **Philosophy Expert Consultation** (Rank 4): $500-1000 (Week 3-4, deferrable)
- [ ] **Metrics Dashboard** (Optional, Phase 6): $0 (use spreadsheets, defer Week 2)
- [ ] **Publication Venue Scouting** (Phase 5): Reduce from 3 venues/paper to 1 venue

**Potential Savings**: $500-1000 (not significant)
