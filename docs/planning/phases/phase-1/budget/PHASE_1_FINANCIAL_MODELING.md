# Phase 1 Financial Modeling: Budget Scenarios & Break-Even Analysis

**Purpose**: Model cost under best/likely/worst-case scenarios. Know at what point to deferral or scope cuts.

**Status**: READY (use to inform negotiation decisions Feb 10-13)

---

## PART 1: BASELINE BUDGET (Locked)

```
STAFFING BREAKDOWN:

FULL-TIME (2 FTE):
├─ Eric Mumford (Research Lead): $3,500/week × 20 weeks = $70,000
└─ Collaborator (Experimentalist): $3,000/week × 20 weeks = $60,000
   └─ Subtotal FTE: $130,000 (83% of budget)

CONTRACTORS (3):
├─ Contractor 1 (Maven Engineer): $50/hr × 96h = $4,800
├─ Contractor 2 (Technical Writer): $75/hr × 256h = $19,200
└─ Contractor 3 (Data Scientist): $43.75/hr × 48h = $2,100
   └─ Subtotal Contractors: $26,100 (17% of budget)

OVERHEAD & CONTINGENCY:
├─ External Recruiter (optional): $1,500
├─ Publication fees (open-access): $2,000-5,000 (NOT in baseline; contingency)
└─ Contingency buffer: $0 (tight budget, no float)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BASELINE TOTAL: $156,100
├─ Status: LOCKED (no contingency)
├─ Approval: Finance approved [date]
└─ Variance: $0 available without scope reduction

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## PART 2: COST SCENARIOS (Best / Likely / Worst Case)

### Scenario A: BEST CASE ($156.1K)

```
ASSUMPTIONS:
├─ All 4 staff hired on first offer (no counter-offers)
├─ Collaborator accepts $3,000/week (no negotiation)
├─ Contractor 1 accepts $50/hr (no premium)
├─ Contractor 2 accepts $75/hr (no premium)
├─ Contractor 3 accepts $43.75/hr (no premium)
├─ No external recruiter needed (hiring succeeds organically)
├─ Publication costs absorbed by institutional sponsors

COST BREAKDOWN:
├─ FTE: $130,000 (Eric + Collaborator)
├─ Contractors: $26,100
├─ Recruiter: $0 (not used)
├─ Publication fees: $0 (external funding)
└─ TOTAL: $156,100

PROBABILITY: 20% (very unlikely; negotiation common)

OUTCOME: All objectives met on budget
└─ Papers published on schedule
└─ No scope reduction
└─ Executive review: "Excellent budget management"
```

---

### Scenario B: LIKELY CASE ($166.1K - $169.1K)

```
ASSUMPTIONS:
├─ Collaborator requests $3.5K/week (10% negotiation premium)
├─ Contractor 1 accepts $50/hr (no negotiation)
├─ Contractor 2 requests $80/hr (3-4% premium)
├─ Contractor 3 accepts $43.75/hr (no negotiation)
├─ External recruiter engaged ($1.5K for de-risking)
├─ Publication costs: $3,000-5,000 (partial external funding, partial internal)

COST BREAKDOWN:
├─ Eric: $70,000 (unchanged)
├─ Collaborator (upgraded): $3,500/wk × 20 = $70,000 (+$10,000)
├─ Contractor 1: $4,800 (unchanged)
├─ Contractor 2 (negotiated): $80/hr × 256h = $20,480 (+$1,280)
├─ Contractor 3: $2,100 (unchanged)
├─ Recruiter: $1,500 (+$1,500)
├─ Publication fees: $3,000-5,000 (+$3-5K) [if in scope]
└─ TOTAL: $166,100 - $169,100

PROBABILITY: 60% (most likely outcome)

OUTCOME: All objectives met; minor budget variance
├─ Total variance: +$10-13K (6-8% over baseline)
├─ Still within acceptable range (below 10% threshold)
├─ No scope reduction needed
└─ Executive review: "Expected cost management; acceptable variance"

MITIGATION (if needed):
├─ Skip external recruiter → Save $1.5K (budget = $164.6K)
├─ Reduce publication costs estimate → Save $1-2K
└─ Total available cuts: $2.5-3.5K
```

---

### Scenario C: WORST CASE ($171.6K - $173.1K)

```
ASSUMPTIONS:
├─ Collaborator requests $3.5K/week (10% premium)
├─ Contractor 1 requests $57/hr (14% premium)
├─ Contractor 2 requests $85/hr (13% premium)
├─ Contractor 3 requests $48/hr (10% premium)
├─ External recruiter engaged ($1.5K)
├─ Publication costs: $5,000 (full internal funding; sponsors pull out)
├─ Process inefficiency: 5 hours admin / legal review ($500 at $100/hr opportunity cost)

COST BREAKDOWN:
├─ Eric: $70,000 (unchanged)
├─ Collaborator (premium): $3,500/wk × 20 = $70,000 (+$10,000)
├─ Contractor 1 (premium): $57/hr × 96h = $5,472 (+$672)
├─ Contractor 2 (premium): $85/hr × 256h = $21,760 (+$2,560)
├─ Contractor 3 (premium): $48/hr × 48h = $2,304 (+$204)
├─ Recruiter: $1,500 (+$1,500)
├─ Publication fees: $5,000 (+$5,000)
├─ Admin overhead: $500 (+$500)
└─ TOTAL: $173,136

PROBABILITY: 15% (unlikely; requires all contractors negotiate hard)

OUTCOME: Budget overrun; scope/timeline negotiation required
├─ Total variance: +$17K (11% over baseline)
├─ Exceeds acceptable range (>10% threshold)
├─ Decision point: Negotiate cuts or secure additional budget

MITIGATION DECISIONS:
├─ Option A: Don't engage external recruiter → Save $1.5K (budget = $171.6K)
├─ Option B: Skip publication fees; apply for external sponsorship → Save $5K (budget = $168.1K)
├─ Option C: Reduce Contractor 2 hours (fewer papers) → Save $2-4K
├─ Option D: Negotiate Contractor premiums down (counter-offer at 5% not 10-15%)
└─ Option E: Defer Contractor 1 or 3 to Phase 2 → Save $5-8K

RECOMMENDED PATH (if worst case occurs):
├─ Primary: Apply external publication funding → Save $5K → Budget = $168.1K
├─ Secondary: Negotiate Contractor 2 to $80/hr (not $85) → Save $1.28K → Budget = $166.8K
├─ Fallback: Skip external recruiter → Save $1.5K → Budget = $172.6K (still over but close)
└─ Last resort: Defer Contractor 3 (lowest impact) → Save $2.1K → Budget = $171K
```

---

## PART 3: BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS (What Triggers Scope Changes?)

```
BUDGET CEILING: $170,000 (acceptable variance = 10% over $156.1K)

IF costs hit:

$156K - $162K (0-4% variance):
├─ Action: Continue as planned
├─ Rationale: Within baseline expectations
└─ No mitigation needed

$162K - $170K (4-10% variance):
├─ Action: Monitor closely; propose cost-saving measures if trending to $170K
├─ Mitigation options (pick 1-2):
│  ├─ [ ] Skip external recruiter (save $1.5K)
│  ├─ [ ] Reduce Contractor 2 hours (100 papers instead of 256h) → Save $3.75K
│  ├─ [ ] Defer Contractor 3 to Phase 2 (save $2.1K)
│  └─ [ ] Negotiate contractor rates down by 5% across board → Save $1.3K
└─ Target: Get back to <$165K without major scope impact

$170K - $175K (10-15% variance):
├─ Action: EXECUTIVE DECISION NEEDED
├─ Rationale: Beyond acceptable variance; scope/timeline trade-off required
├─ Options:
│  ├─ Option A: Secure additional budget ($15-20K supplement from contingency)
│  ├─ Option B: Reduce scope (defer 1 paper + Contractor 1 to Phase 2)
│  │  └─ Save $7K; publish 4 papers instead of 5
│  │
│  └─ Option C: Extend timeline (defer end date to Jul 10 to recoup hours)
│     └─ Spread same costs over 5 additional weeks = less weekly intensity
│
└─ Timeline: Escalation decision must be made within 24h of hitting $170K

>$175K (>15% variance):
├─ Action: MAJOR SCOPE REDUCTION OR PROJECT HALT
├─ Rationale: Unacceptable variance; project economics broken
├─ Options:
│  ├─ Option A: Reduce to "Collaborator ONLY" (hire 1 FTE, defer contractors)
│  │  └─ New budget: $135K; saves $38-40K
│  │
│  ├─ Option B: Extend timeline 8+ weeks (spread costs, reduce intensity)
│  │  └─ 28 weeks instead of 20; lower weekly burn
│  │
│  └─ Option C: Cancel Phase 1; reassess in Q3 2026
│
└─ Timeline: Executive decision by EOD same day

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DECISION THRESHOLD SUMMARY:

$156.1K (baseline):  ✓ GO (optimal)
$156-170K:           ✓ GO (acceptable, monitor)
$170-175K:           ⚠ ESCALATE (request executive decision)
>$175K:              ⚠ STOP (major scope reduction required)
```

## PART 4: CONTRACTOR RATE NEGOTIATIONS (Dollar Impact Analysis)

### If Collaborator Asks for More ($3.5K/week)

```
INCREASE: $3,500/week - $3,000/week = $500/week × 20 weeks = $10,000 additional

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
├─ Candidate quality scorecard: 4.0-5.0?
│  ├─ YES (4.0+): PAY IT (quality worth premium; critical hire)
│  └─ NO (3.5-3.9): PASS (not worth $10K premium; activate backup)
│
├─ Budget impact: +$10K (total budget = $166.1K)
│  └─ Within acceptable range (10.4% variance)
│
└─ Recommendation:
   ├─ If scorecard 4.2+: Offer $3.5K (sunk cost = high quality gain)
   ├─ If scorecard 4.0-4.1: Negotiate to $3.2K/week (split difference, save $6K)
   └─ If scorecard 3.8-3.9: PASS (activate backup at $3K/week)
```

---

### If Contractor 1 (Maven) Asks for More ($57/hr)

```
INCREASE: $57/hr - $50/hr = $7/hr × 96 hours = $672 additional

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
├─ Candidate quality: Code review shows 4.5+ architecture excellence?
│  ├─ YES: OFFER $57/hr (rare talent, justify cost)
│  └─ NO: PASS (activate backup at $50/hr)
│
├─ Budget impact: +$672 (total budget = $156.8K)
│  └─ Minimal impact (0.4% variance); accept
│
└─ Recommendation:
   ├─ If portfolio review showed exceptional code: Upgrade to $5.5K ($57/hr)
   ├─ If portfolio showed solid but not exceptional: PASS (many Maven engineers available)
   └─ Total Maven budget: $4.8-5.5K (flexible range)
```

---

### If Contractor 2 (Writer) Asks for More ($80-90/hr)

```
RATE INCREASE OPTIONS:

Request $80/hr: +$80/hr - $75/hr = $5/hr × 256h = $1,280 additional
├─ Decision: Scorecard 4.0+? → ACCEPT (papers critical path; writing quality matters)
├─ Budget impact: +$1.28K (acceptable)
└─ Total writer budget: $20.48K

Request $85/hr: +$85/hr - $75/hr = $10/hr × 256h = $2,560 additional
├─ Decision: Scorecard 4.3+? → NEGOTIATE to $80/hr instead
│  If insists on $85: Scorecard 4.5+? → ACCEPT only if truly exceptional
├─ Budget impact: +$2.56K (moderate but acceptable)
└─ Total writer budget: $21.76K

Request $90/hr: +$15/hr × 256h = $3,840 additional
├─ Decision: PASS immediately (too high; activate backup)
├─ Rationale: Many qualified writers available at $75-85/hr; don't overpay
└─ Total writer budget stays: $19.2K

DECISION LOGIC (Writer is CRITICAL path; don't be stingy):
├─ Baseline ($75/hr): Solid writers accept this rate
├─ Premium ($80/hr): Top-tier writers; justify if scorecard 4.0+
├─ High premium ($85/hr): Only for published researchers with 5+ papers
├─ Ceiling ($85/hr): Do NOT exceed; activate backup if demanded more
└─ Budget reserved for writer: $19.2-21.8K (flexible based on quality)
```

---

### If Contractor 3 (Data Scientist) Asks for More ($48/hr)

```
INCREASE: $48/hr - $43.75/hr = $4.25/hr × 48 hours = $204 additional

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
├─ Candidate quality: Rare domain expertise (chaos engineering)?
│  ├─ YES: ACCEPT $48/hr (niche expertise worth premium)
│  └─ NO: PASS (large pool; many statisticians at $43.75/hr)
│
├─ Budget impact: +$204 (minimal; 0.1% variance)
│  └─ Accept without escalation
│
└─ Recommendation:
   ├─ If candidate has published resilience papers: Offer $48/hr ($2.3K total)
   ├─ If candidate only has generic statistics background: PASS (activate backup)
   └─ Total data sci budget: $2.1-2.3K (low variance)
```

---

## PART 5: PUBLICATION COST RESERVE

```
PUBLICATION FEES (NOT in baseline budget; contingency item):

COST PER PAPER:
├─ Typical open-access conference fee: $500-1,000/paper
├─ High-tier venue (OOPSLA): $800-1,500/paper
├─ Journal fee (if publishing): $1,000-3,000/paper
├─ Total for 3-5 papers: $2,000-7,500

BASELINE ASSUMPTION:
├─ Conference sponsors external funding (0 cost to Samstraumr)
├─ Guild Mortgage covers 1 paper fee (~$1K)
└─ Author funds / department grants cover rest

BUDGET CONTINGENCY:
├─ If external funding falls through: Allocate $3-5K from contingency
├─ If multiple papers require author funding: Allocate $5-7K
└─ Worst case: All publication fees internal → $6,000 needed

DECISION:
├─ If publication fees emerge as issue: Apply for external sponsor support FIRST
├─ Fallback: Allocate from contingency
├─ Last resort: Reduce contingency for other uses (overtime, admin, etc.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BUDGET SCENARIO IMPACT:

Scenario A (Best Case):    Publication fees: $0 (external funded)
Scenario B (Likely Case):  Publication fees: $3-5K (partial external + Guild)
Scenario C (Worst Case):   Publication fees: $5-7K (internal only)

Note: If publication costs hit >$5K, trigger executive decision on budget reallocation.
```

## PART 6: FINANCIAL DECISION TREE (Feb 10-13 Usage)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINANCIAL DECISION FRAMEWORK: Use Daily During Recruiting

DAILY CHECKPOINT (EOD each day Feb 10-13):

"What's our projected budget based on recruitment activity so far?"

STEP 1: COUNT NEGOTIATION SIGNALS
├─ [ ] Collaborator candidate asking about salary flexibility?
├─ [ ] Any contractor requesting portfolio-based negotiation?
├─ [ ] Finance signaling budget tightness?
└─ How many signals: _____ (0=unlikely negotiation, 3+=probable)

STEP 2: ADJUST PROJECTED BUDGET
├─ Baseline: $156.1K
├─ Add contingency for each signal: +$2-3K per signal
├─ Projected budget: $_____ (e.g., baseline + 3 signals = $162.1K)

STEP 3: ASSESS BUFFER
├─ Projected budget within $170K ceiling?
│  ├─ YES: ✓ Continue normal recruiting (no constraints)
│  └─ NO: ⚠ Flag constraints → Don't overpay on negotiables
│
└─ How much buffer remaining? $_____ (target: $7-10K buffer left)

STEP 4: DECISION RULES FOR NEGOTIATIONS
├─ If buffer > $10K: Can afford all 4 quality upgrades
│  └─ Approve premiums up to 10% across board
│
├─ If buffer $5-10K: Can afford 2-3 strategic upgrades
│  └─ Prioritize: Collaborator > Contractor 2 (writer) > Contractor 1 > Contractor 3
│
├─ If buffer < $5K: Tighten controls
│  └─ Approve only critical premium (Collaborator or Contractor 2)
│
└─ If buffer < $0: STOP approving premiums; activate backup hires only at baseline rates

EXAMPLE:
├─ Current status (Feb 12): 3 negotiations likely
├─ Projected budget: $156.1K + (3 signals × $2.5K) = $163.6K
├─ Buffer remaining: $170K ceiling - $163.6K projected = $6.4K
├─ Decision: Can still afford 1-2 upgrades; be selective
├─ Action: Offer $3.5K to Collaborator if score 4.0+ (priority hire)
│          Stay firm at $75/hr for writers (less critical premium)
└─ Result: Keep budget in acceptable range

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## PART 7: EXECUTIVE ESCALATION (Budget Overrun Path)

```
IF ACTUAL COSTS EXCEED $170K:

DECISION POINT 1 (at $165-170K projected):
├─ Notify: CFO + Executive Sponsor
├─ Message: "Recruiting negotiations trending above baseline. Projected budget: $[X]K.
│           Recommend one of:
│           A) Negotiate contractor rates down 5%
│           B) Defer Contractor 1 or 3 to Phase 2
│           C) Reduce paper scope (4 instead of 5)"
│
└─ Timeline: Decision needed within 24h if trending to $170K

DECISION POINT 2 (at $170-175K actual):
├─ Severity: MEDIUM (10-15% overrun)
├─ Notification: Executive Sponsor + CFO
├─ Options:
│  ├─ [ ] Supplement budget (request $15-20K emergency allocation)
│  ├─ [ ] Reduce scope (defer 1 paper + 1 contractor to Phase 2; save $7-8K)
│  └─ [ ] Extend timeline (28 weeks instead of 20; spread costs)
│
└─ Timeline: Decision by EOD same day cost hits $170K

DECISION POINT 3 (at >$175K actual):
├─ Severity: CRITICAL (>15% overrun)
├─ Notification: Executive Sponsor + Board (if applicable)
├─ Decision required:
│  ├─ [ ] Secure major budget supplement ($20K+)
│  ├─ [ ] Reduce to "Collaborator ONLY" (defer contractors; save $26K)
│  └─ [ ] Cancel Phase 1 (reassess later)
│
└─ Timeline: Emergency decision (same day; cannot delay)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COST ESCALATION EMAIL TEMPLATE (If needed):

Subject: Samstraumr Phase 1 - Budget Escalation Required

Hi [CFO/Executive Sponsor],

Recruiting negotiations for Phase 1 are trending above baseline. Current projections:

BASELINE:     $156.1K
LIKELY CASE:  $163-166K (3-7% variance, acceptable)
CURRENT PROJ: $[X]K ([Y]% variance)

DRIVERS:
├─ Collaborator candidate requesting $3.5K/week (+$10K)
├─ Contractor 2 (writer) requesting $80-85/hr (+$1.3-2.6K)
└─ External recruiter engagement (+$1.5K)

DECISION NEEDED:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IF Budget <$170K (10% variance): ✓ PROCEED (acceptable) │
│ IF Budget $170-175K (10-15%):    ⚠ DECIDE (A/B/C above)│
│ IF Budget >$175K (>15%):         🛑 ESCALATE (major call)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Recommend: [Your recommendation A/B/C]
Timeline: Decision needed by [DATE]

Please confirm approval.

## SUMMARY: BUDGET FINANCIAL HEALTH

```
BUDGET STATUS: TIGHT BUT MANAGEABLE

Baseline:            $156,100
Acceptable Range:    $156K - $170K (±10%)
Contingency Margin:  $0 (none in baseline)
Probable Outcome:    $163-169K (likely case)

FINANCIAL RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM
├─ Positive: Tight budget encourages cost discipline
├─ Risk: No buffer for surprises (publication fees, admin)
├─ Mitigation: Reserve external publication funding; negotiate rates strategically

KEY FINANCIAL DECISIONS:
✓ Approve Collaborator premium (+$10K) if scorecard 4.0+ (critical hire)
✓ Approve Contractor 2 premium (+$1.3K) if scorecard 4.0+ (papers critical)
⚠ Negotiate Contractor 1/3 premiums down 5-7% (many alternatives available)
⚠ Engage external recruiter only if application volume <6 (cost justified by quality)
✓ Reserve publication funding externally (don't burn budget on author fees)

BREAK-EVEN: All 4 staff hired at baseline rates = $156.1K (best case, 20% probability)

MOST LIKELY: Collaborator + Contractor 2 negotiate premiums = $166-168K (60% probability)

TARGET: Close negotiations by Feb 13 to know final budget; scope adjustments by Feb 14 if needed.
```
