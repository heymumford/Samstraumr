## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

✅ **Do This**:
- Be decisive (don't overthink candidate selection)
- Personalize recruitment emails (shows you know their work)
- Use the scorecard during phone screens (objective evaluation)
- Send offers same day as phone screen (momentum)
- Have contracts ready to send by Feb 13 morning

❌ **Avoid This**:
- Analysis paralysis (pick best candidate, move on)
- Generic emails (candidates won't respond)
- Making offers without seeing full picture (phone screen validates)
- Delaying contracting (they need time to read, sign, return)
- Changing your mind mid-week (costs hiring speed)

## IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Collaborator not available
- **Impact**: 🔴 CRITICAL — timeline shifts, gates compressed
- **Action**: Activate backup immediately (alternate candidate from phone screens)
- **Timeline**: Start date Feb 24 instead of Feb 17 (1-week delay, cascades)

### Contractor 1 (Tooling) unavailable
- **Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM — smart linter delayed but not blocking
- **Action**: Use backup engineer or Eric implements manually (20h added)
- **Timeline**: Can absorb 2-week slip without major impact

### Contractor 2 (Writer) unavailable
- **Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM — papers need more Eric involvement
- **Action**: Use backup writer or Eric outlines + writer polishes
- **Timeline**: Might slip publication by 1-2 weeks

### Contractor 3 (Data Sci) unavailable
- **Impact**: 🟡 LOW-MEDIUM — Collaborator can handle basic analysis
- **Action**: Defer to Collaborator + Eric, or use backup statistician
- **Timeline**: Can absorb with some quality risk

### Finance approval delayed
- **Impact**: 🔴 CRITICAL — CANNOT HIRE without budget
- **Action**: Escalate to Executive Sponsor immediately (Feb 10, no later)
- **Timeline**: If delayed >1 day, cascade all dates forward

## YOUR DECISION CRITERIA

### Collaborator (FTE)
- **Must Have**: 5+ years statistics/data science, Python or R proficiency, empirical research
- **Must Have**: Comfort with ambiguity (recovery might fail), detail-oriented
- **Red Flag**: "I'll need 2 weeks to onboard" → PASS (need immediate productivity)
- **Decision**: Hire someone you'd want in the room during Gate 4 (Week 15)

### Contractor 1 (Tooling)
- **Must Have**: Maven plugin experience OR strong willingness to learn
- **Must Have**: Understands Clean Architecture (not just coding)
- **Red Flag**: "I can do linting" but no portfolio → PASS

### Contractor 2 (Writer)
- **Must Have**: 2+ published papers, academic writing portfolio
- **Must Have**: Understands stats (won't butcher the data)
- **Red Flag**: "I can write fast" but no samples → PASS

### Contractor 3 (Data Scientist)
- **Must Have**: Statistical expertise (published work, degrees, or both)
- **Must Have**: Can explain stats to non-statisticians
- **Red Flag**: Any hedging on methodology → PASS

## COMPENSATION (LOCKED)

**FTE**:
- Eric: $3,500/week × 20 = $70,000
- Collaborator: $3,000/week × 20 = $60,000

**Contractors**:
- Contractor 1: $4,800 fixed
- Contractor 2: $19,200 time-and-materials
- Contractor 3: $2,100 fixed

**Total**: $156,100 (ZERO contingency — must execute efficiently)

---

## THE ONE THING THAT CAN'T SLIP

**Week 1 Kickoff: Feb 17, 9 AM PT**

If Collaborator or budget approval delayed, you still kick off on Feb 17 with available staff and adjust scope. BUT you cannot move the kickoff date because:
- Gate 1 (Week 4) cascades from Week 1
- Gate 4 (Week 15) is existential → must happen on schedule
- Papers submitted Week 16+ → fixed deadline

**So plan accordingly: Feb 17 kickoff happens NO MATTER WHAT.**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Print PHASE_1_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md** (use as daily guide)
2. **Gather candidate contacts** (before Feb 10 start)
3. **Prepare budget approval request** (send to Finance Feb 10 morning)
4. **Customize PHASE_1_RECRUITMENT_EMAIL.md** (add real names, dates)
5. **Start Feb 10 at 8 AM** (first task: budget approval)

**Ready to execute. You have all the materials. Now hire great people.**
