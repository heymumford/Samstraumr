## SECTION 3: ESCALATION EMAILS

### Template 6: Finance Escalation (Urgent Budget Approval)

```
SUBJECT: URGENT: Samstraumr Phase 1 Budget Approval Required by 10 AM Tomorrow

Hi [CFO/Finance Director Name],

I need budget approval for Samstraumr Phase 1 research project:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BUDGET REQUEST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Total:              $164,100 (20 weeks, Feb 17 - Jun 26, 2026)
Breakdown:
  • Eric Mumford (Principal):      $70,000 (salary + overhead)
  • Collaborator (Hired):          $60,000 (salary)
  • Contractors (3):               $26,100 (tooling, writing, statistics)
  • Contingency / Publications:    $8,000 (open-access fees, reserves)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL TIMELINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ Approval needed:    Tomorrow, 10 AM PT (Feb 10)
✓ Hiring begins:      Feb 10, afternoon (recruitment launch)
✓ Kickoff:            Feb 17, 9 AM PT (immovable; cascades all downstream gates)

If approval delayed past Feb 10, we lose 1-2 days of recruiting window. If we can't complete
hiring by Feb 13, we defer kickoff to Feb 24 (cascades entire publication timeline).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT'S NEEDED FROM YOU
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Approval signature on attached PHASE_1_BUDGET_SUMMARY.md
2. Confirmation to Payroll that Collaborator hire is authorized
3. Confirmation to Legal that contractor agreements can be signed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUESTIONS?

### Template 7: Collaborator Hiring Escalation (Timeline Slip)

```
SUBJECT: Samstraumr Phase 1 Status: Collaborator Hiring Extension Required

Hi [Executive Sponsor],

Quick update on Phase 1 staffing: Collaborator hiring timeline has shifted. I'm activating
the backup hiring plan and adjusting timeline.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SITUATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Original Plan:  Hire by Feb 13, start Feb 17
New Reality:   Primary candidate [passed / rejected]. Activating backup candidate.
Impact:        Start date moves to Feb 24 or Mar 3 (TBD by Feb 13, 6 PM)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CASCADING TIMELINE CHANGES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If Feb 24 start (1 week delay):
  • All Phase 1 gates shift 1 week later
  • OOPSLA 2026 deadline (May 1) is now tight but achievable
  • Publication timeline remains on track for summer submission

If Mar 3 start (2 weeks delay):
  • OOPSLA deadline at risk; likely defer to ESEM 2026 (Aug 1)
  • Phase 1 gates shift 2 weeks later
  • Final deliverable date moves to Jul 3 (1 week past original Jun 26)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION NEEDED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

By Feb 13, 6 PM, I'll know if we need Feb 24 or Mar 3 start. I'm recommending:
"Accept Feb 24 slip; it's within acceptable buffer and ensures collaborator quality."

Rationale: Better to hire right person late than wrong person on time. Collaborator
quality is critical for experimental design (Gate 1, Week 4).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MITIGATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• I'm activating backup candidate immediately
• Contractors remain on schedule (they start Weeks 3-5)
• 1-week slip is recoverable with aggressive Week 3-8 schedule
• 2-week slip requires scope reduction (defer Paper 5 / Rank 4 feature)

Will update you by Feb 13, 6 PM with final decision.

Eric
```

## SECTION 4: CONTRACTOR BRIEFING SCRIPTS

### Template 8: Maven Engineer Phone Call Script (If Rejected by Primary)

```
[Backup Maven Engineer Phone Call - Feb 13, ~5:15 PM]

OPENING:
"Hi [Name], Eric Mumford from Samstraumr. Quick call—I want to bring you an opportunity.
We're building a smart architecture linter for a consciousness-aware systems research project.
I'm thinking of you because of your work on [specific project they're familiar with].

Is this a good time for a quick conversation?"

[IF YES]

PITCH (2 minutes):
"We need a Maven plugin engineer to develop an architecture linter that catches Clean Architecture
violations. The work is:
  • 96 hours, Weeks 5-12 (Feb 24 - Apr 18)
  • $50/hour fixed-price ($4,800 total)
  • Two milestones: architecture design ($2K) + implementation ($2.8K)
  • Technical challenge: designing plugin lifecycle + integration

It's a research project with potential publication credit if the work merits it.

Does this sound interesting?"

[IF HESITANT]

HANDLE OBJECTIONS:
• "Timeline tight?" → "Yeah, 8-week window is compressed. But it's defined—you know exactly
  when it ends. Not open-ended."

• "Rate low?" → "It's fair market for Maven specialists. The appeal is the technical challenge
  + defined scope + possible publication credit."

• "Never heard of Samstraumr" → "New research project. You'd be part of core infrastructure team.
  Rare chance to influence system design from the ground up."

[IF INTERESTED]

CLOSE:
"Great. Here's what happens next: I'll send you a contract and scope document today.
Can you review by tomorrow morning and let me know if you're in?

Payment is Net 15: First invoice due Apr 4 ($2K), second due Apr 18 ($2.8K).
Any questions before I send the paperwork?"

[IF THEY AGREE]

"Perfect. Sending contract + scope now. You'll get email in the next 30 minutes.
Reply with questions, or just confirm tomorrow AM and we're set."

[CLOSE CALL]
```

### Template 9: Writer Phone Call Script (Counter-Offer Negotiation)

```
[Writer Phone Call - Feb 12 afternoon, if negotiating $75 → $85/hr]

SITUATION: Writer scored 4.2-4.5 on scorecard. Asked for $85/hr instead of $75/hr.

NEGOTIATION SCRIPT:

"I totally understand why you're asking for $85. You have strong publication track record
and the writing quality is exceptional. Here's how I see it:

We have a tight timeline (papers due May-Jun), and your experience makes a real difference
in whether we hit those deadlines. I value that.

Here's my offer: $85/hr, but let me set context:
  • This is T&M, so if we finish papers in 200 hours instead of 256, you save time + we save cost
  • We can start at $80/hr weeks 8-10 (ramp-up phase), then $85/hr weeks 11-20 (full production)
    This lets you prove capacity before going to premium rate
  • Or, we can do $85/hr flat if you're comfortable committing to quality expectations
    (we're willing to pay for excellence)

What feels right to you? Do you prefer the ramp, or flat $85/hr?"

[LISTEN TO RESPONSE]

• If they say "Ramp works": Great! That's actually clever—you both benefit if we're efficient.
• If they say "Flat $85/hr": Acceptable if scorecard is truly 4.3+. Say yes.
• If they say "$90/hr or nothing": That's too high. Say: "I can't go higher than $85.
  Would that work, or do we need to part ways?"

[IF THEY ACCEPT]

"Fantastic. I'm thrilled to have you on the team. I'll send the updated contract within
the hour with $85/hr. Can you sign by tomorrow morning?"
```

just freed up and I want to bring you an opportunity while it's fresh.

We're hiring a Collaborator for a 20-week research project starting Feb 17. You came
up in my network as someone with strong empirical research background. Do you have 10
minutes to chat?"

[IF YES]

PITCH (1 minute):
"Samstraumr is a novel research project on consciousness-aware systems architecture.
We're hiring an experimentalist to design and execute core experiments. 20 weeks,
starting Feb 17, $3,000/week.

The work is intense, intellectually novel, and directly influences publication outcomes
(you'll co-author 2-3 papers targeting OOPSLA/ESEM tier venues).

Interested?"

[IF INTERESTED]

"Perfect. Here's the accelerated timeline:
  • Phone screen: Tomorrow morning (Feb 14) if possible
  • Offer: By Feb 14, 2 PM (if interview goes well)
  • Start: Feb 17 (Monday)

This is compressed, but I think you're a strong fit. Can you do a 30-min call tomorrow
morning? 9 AM or 10 AM PT?"
