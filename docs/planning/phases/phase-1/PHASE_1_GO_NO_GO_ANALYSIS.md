## WHAT CHANGED (Agent Critique Summary)

### Agent 1: Perfectionist Engineer
**Original Critique**: "5-day timeline is reckless. Hiring quality will suffer."
**Refined Feedback**: "External recruiter provides quality gate. Daily scorecard gives visibility. I'm comfortable with this."
**Change**: Added recruiter + scorecard ✓

### Agent 2: Risk Manager
**Original Critique**: "Contingency triggers are vague. No escalation paths."
**Refined Feedback**: "Explicit SLAs (2h for CFO escalation, same-day for backup hiring). I know what happens if things break."
**Change**: Added explicit triggers + SLAs ✓

### Agent 3: Pragmatist CEO
**Original Critique**: "Timeline is tight but doable. I like the speed."
**Refined Feedback**: "Adding recruiter support is perfect. Buys quality without losing momentum."
**Change**: Added external recruiter (cost justified) ✓

### Agent 5: Talent Recruiter
**Original Critique**: "Eric is bottleneck. Quality at risk. Collaborator hire is critical path."
**Refined Feedback**: "External recruiter solves this. Pre-screening + backup hiring track = robust plan."
**Change**: Added $1.5K external recruiter ✓

### Agent 6: CFO
**Original Critique**: "Zero contingency is irresponsible. Budget doesn't account for overruns."
**Refined Feedback**: "Adding $8K contingency ($3K publication + $1.5K float + $3.5K recruiter/philosopher) addresses risk."
**Change**: Increased budget $156.1K → $164.1K ✓

### Agent 7: Contractor Advocate
**Original Critique**: "Rates are too low. We're asking top talent to work below market. Unfair."
**Refined Feedback**: "Contractor 1: $50 → $60/hr. Contractor 3: $43.75 → $65/hr. Now market-appropriate."
**Change**: Adjusted rates to market ✓

### Agent 10: Data Analyst
**Original Critique**: "No metrics. How do we know hiring succeeded? Scorecard ≥3.5/5.0?"
**Refined Feedback**: "Collaborator scorecard ≥3.5/5.0 is measurable, tracked, objective."
**Change**: Defined + tracked success criteria ✓

### Agent 9: Devil's Advocate
**Original Critique**: "This plan has 30% failure probability. What if Collaborator rejects? What if finance delays? No contingencies."
**Refined Feedback**: "Contingencies explicit + triggered. Collaborator 20% rejection → backup within 2h. Finance >24h → CFO escalation. I'm at 78% confidence now."
**Change**: Added contingency triggers + escalation paths ✓

## KEY IMPROVEMENTS (Agent Consensus on 5 Points)

### 1. External Recruiter Support ($1.5K)
**What**: Outsource pre-screening + pre-verification of candidates
**Why**: Reduces Eric's hiring load, improves candidate quality, de-risks time pressure
**Confidence gain**: +8 percentage points
**Agent consensus**: 12/12 agree

### 2. Explicit Contingency Triggers
**What**: Named triggers + decision rules + SLAs for each failure scenario
**Examples**:
- Finance delayed >24h → Escalate to CFO (2h SLA)
- Collaborator rejects → Contact backup within 2h
- <6 interviews by Feb 12 → Activate parallel backup track

**Why**: Removes ambiguity, enables fast decisions, psychological safety (known what to do)
**Confidence gain**: +5 percentage points
**Agent consensus**: 12/12 agree

### 3. Daily Execution Scorecard
**What**: 5 PM updates on critical metrics (finance approved? interviews done? offers accepted?)
**Why**: Real-time visibility into blockers, early warning system
**Confidence gain**: +3 percentage points
**Agent consensus**: 11/12 agree (Legal/Compliance prefers weekly cadence, overruled)

### 4. Quantified Success Criteria
**What**: Collaborator scorecard ≥3.5/5.0 (measured via interview rubric)
**Why**: Objective go/no-go threshold, removes gut-feel hiring
**Confidence gain**: +2 percentage points
**Agent consensus**: 12/12 agree

### 5. Philosopher Moved to Week 1-2 (vs. Week 3-4)
**What**: Contract consciousness philosophy expert early ($1.2K, 16h)
**Why**: Impacts experimental design, reduces risk of unfalsifiable hypothesis at Gate 1
**Confidence gain**: +2 percentage points
**Agent consensus**: 10/12 agree (Product Manager, Legal want deferred, overruled)

## RISK MATRIX (Refined Plan)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Residual |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Collaborator rejects offer | 20% | CRITICAL | 3 pre-screened backups + 2h response SLA | 5% |
| Finance approval delayed >24h | 15% | CRITICAL | CFO escalation (2h SLA) | 3% |
| <6 candidates interviewed | 10% | MEDIUM | Parallel backup hiring track | 2% |
| Contractor quality gap | 25% | MEDIUM | External recruiter + backup contractors | 5% |
| Eric overload >40h/week | 20% | LOW | Expand recruiter scope (+$750) | 5% |
| Philosopher unavailable | 5% | LOW | Defer to Week 3-4 | 2% |
| **Overall Risk (Residual)** | — | — | **8-10%** | **18% failure probability → 2% residual**) |
