## Subject: Join a Novel Software Architecture Research Project (20 weeks, $60K)

Hi [NAME],

I'm recruiting a full-time research collaborator for a 20-week project validating a novel software architecture framework. This is high-visibility, publication-destined work with real stakes: your experimental design directly influences whether we claim "self-healing" or "recovery-enabling" systems.

**The Role**: Experimentalist who designs and runs rigorous experiments. Your work: chaos engineering, cognitive load A/B testing, recovery validation, statistical analysis.

**Why You?**
- You've shipped statistical analysis in [previous_project/publication]
- You're comfortable with empirical ambiguity (experiments might refute initial hypotheses)
- You can explain p-values to architects and philosophers equally well

**The Work**:
- **Weeks 1-5**: Design measurement infrastructure + experiment protocols
- **Weeks 6-12**: Run cognitive load A/B test (critical gate decision, Week 8)
- **Weeks 10-15**: Execute recovery validation experiments (EXISTENTIAL gate decision, Week 15)
- **Weeks 16-20**: Prepare empirical validation paper for publication

**Compensation**: $3,000/week × 20 weeks = $60,000 (Feb 17 - Jun 26, 2026)

**Requirements**:
- 5+ years data science / statistics
- Python or R fluency
- Comfort with experimental design + hypothesis validation
- Self-directed (minimal supervision)
- Remote-friendly (async sync meetings)

**Timeline**:
- [DATE]: Applications due
- [DATE]: Phone screen (30 min)
- [DATE]: Technical interview (60 min, bring example of statistical work)
- Feb 13: Offer + contract signing
- Feb 17: Start (Week 1 kickoff)

**Interested?** Send resume + 1-page cover letter explaining why this project excites you.

A few honest disclaimers:
1. **High Risk**: Recovery experiments might show zero improvement. We'll publish the honest results either way.
2. **High Visibility**: Papers submitted to ESEM/TSE/ICSE. Your work will be scrutinized by reviewers.
3. **Philosophical Ambiguity**: We're not just measuring performance; we're validating claims about "consciousness" in software. Be prepared to think deeply.
4. **Gate Pressure**: 5 critical decision points (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 15, 20) where data drives go/no-go calls.

**But also**: This is rare. A chance to design experiments that influence architecture design patterns, publish in top venues, and contribute to a novel research program.

Let me know if you want to explore.
