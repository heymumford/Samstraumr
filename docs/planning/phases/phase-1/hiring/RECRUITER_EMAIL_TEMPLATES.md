## EMAIL 3: ANGEL LIST / INDEED POSTING

**Title**: Research Experimentalist – Consciousness & Resilience Architecture

**Description**:

```
ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Samstraumr is a research initiative exploring consciousness, resilience, and
self-healing architectures in distributed systems. We're at the experimental
validation stage and need ONE research experimentalist to lead this critical phase.

THE ROLE:
You'll design and execute rigorous experiments to validate our architecture's
resilience claims. Your work will directly determine the success of our research
narrative (5 academic papers).

RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Recovery Experiment Leadership: Design failure injection tests (must show ≥70%
  success rate). This is the critical path experiment.
- Cognitive Load Measurement: A/B study with 50+ developers to validate that our
  consciousness metaphor improves code clarity.
- Chaos Engineering Testing: Deploy failure injection framework; test 15+
  failure scenarios.
- Statistical Analysis: Support data scientist on statistical power, confidence
  intervals, effect sizes.
- State Machine Coverage: Instrument system; measure transition coverage over time.

QUALIFICATIONS:
- Experimental design (thesis or published research strongly preferred)
- Statistics (frequentist: t-tests, ANOVAs, confidence intervals; Bayesian welcome)
- Programming (Python or R for analysis; Java/Kotlin for test implementation)
- Systems thinking (distributed systems, failure modes, resilience concepts)
- Chaos engineering experience (Gremlin, Chaos Mesh) – nice to have

COMPENSATION & DETAILS:
- Salary: $3,000/week × 20 weeks = $60,000 total
- FTE: 1.0 (40 hours/week)
- Duration: Feb 17 - Jun 26, 2026
- Status: Independent contractor / Research fellow
- Location: Remote (fully flexible, based in any timezone)
- Equipment: Laptop provided or $1,500 stipend

TIMELINE:
- Posting: Feb 10, 2026
- Applications close: Feb 12, 5 PM PT
- Interviews: Feb 13-14
- Offer decision: Feb 14, 6 PM PT
- Start date: Feb 17, 10 AM PT
- Onboarding: Feb 16 (4 hours prep session)

TO APPLY:
1. Resume + CV
2. Describe one experiment you've designed (1-2 paragraphs)
3. Why you're excited about this work
4. Your availability for Thu Feb 13 or Fri Feb 14 (30-min interview)

CONTACT:
eric@samstraumr.dev

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
Samstraumr explores the hypothesis that software systems can be conscious of
their own recovery. This is a rigorous research project with peer review and
academic publication as the outcome. We need serious scientists who value
falsifiability and statistical rigor over clever engineering.

If you love experimental design, statistics, and systems thinking – this is for you.

2. Offer same position: same compensation, same start date
3. Target: Contract signed by Tue Feb 18 (1 day late)

**Alternative** (if still no hire):
1. Split Collaborator role: Eric 50% + 1 contractor 50%
2. Reduce other scope (defer Rank 11, 20 cognitive load study to Phase 2)
3. Proceed with Week 1 with temporary gap
4. Continue recruitment in background (can hire for Weeks 5-20 later)

## NOTES FOR ERIC

**Tone**: Professional but genuine. Avoid corporate-speak. This IS real science.

**Key messages to emphasize**:
- Rigorous experimental methodology required (not just engineering)
- Gate 4 Week 15: Recovery experiments are existential to project success
- Publication path: Co-authorship on papers (if results merit)
- This is short-term focused work (20 weeks, then done)
- Fully remote, flexible hours

**Don't oversell**:
- Don't claim this will change the world (let results speak)
- Don't hide the Gate 4 risk (be honest about "recovery <70% = pivot narrative")
- Don't promise promotion or full-time employment (be clear: contract only)
