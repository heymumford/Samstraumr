# S8r Project Kanban Board

This document tracks the progress of tasks in the S8r project.

## Tasks In Backlog

- Set up CI/CD for S8r structure
- Create comprehensive test suite in the new structure
- Implement feedback mechanism for migration issues
- Update documentation with component diagrams
- Implement Clean Architecture verification in CI/CD

## Tasks In Progress

- Create migration utilities for client code
- Test the new Maven structure end-to-end
- Implement core components in the new package structure
- Execute TODO standardization across the codebase
- Implement documentation CI integration (Phase 5 of documentation plan)
- Fix Clean Architecture compliance issues (85% complete)
- Standardize test tags and organization (tag structure defined, implementation in progress)

## Tasks Done

- Establish new Maven structure with s8r naming
- Create core Component class as a replacement for Tube
- Document API changes between Samstraumr and S8r
- Create migration guides for teams using the library
- Implement Composite and Machine in new structure
- Implement automated documentation generation system (Phases 1-4)
- Implement TODO standardization tooling and standards
- Complete research document on AI-enhanced testing strategies (see /docs/research/test-in-age-of-ai.md)
- Complete package-info.java files for all packages (57/57 packages, 100% complete)
- Refactor initialization package into Clean Architecture (application, infrastructure, adapter layers)
- Refactor adapter layer to use reflection instead of direct dependencies on legacy code
