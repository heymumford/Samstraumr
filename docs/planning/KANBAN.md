This document tracks the progress of tasks in the S8r project.

## Tasks in Backlog

- Implement TDD acceptance tests for Atomic Tube Identity after S8r framework stabilization

## Tasks in Progress


## Tasks Completed Today

- Implement documentation phase 4 (planning document cleanup)
  - Archive completed planning documents
  - Rename documents to follow kebab-case convention
  - Update plan status document
  - Create proper README in completed directory
- Implement documentation phase 3 (content standardization)
  - Update headers to follow standard conventions
  - Standardize cross-references
  - Standardize code blocks and formatting
- Scan root directory for non-README .md files that may contain tests we want to add or update to our test pyramid
- Reorganize scripts from root directory to appropriate utility directories
- Implement test scenarios from markdown files into the test pyramid
- Test build process with comprehensive BDD tests
- Create test migration approach with atomic component identity tests
- Implement robust version management with context-aware search and replace

## Tasks in Review

- Implement BDD integration tests for ports

- Implement TDD-driven port interface tests
- Enhance NotificationPort with additional notification channels and testing
- Finalize documentation for the migration utilities
- Implement integration test suite for port interfaces working together (partial)
- Create BDD tests for remaining port interfaces
- Implement remaining port interfaces according to TDD plan (ValidationPort, PersistencePort)
- Implement Clean Architecture verification in CI/CD
- Set up CI/CD for S8r structure
- Implement feedback mechanism for migration issues
- Update documentation with component diagrams

## Tasks Done

- Create migration utilities for client code (Component, Composite, and Machine adapters)
- Establish new Maven structure with s8r naming
- Create core Component class as a replacement for Tube
- Document API changes between Samstraumr and S8r
- Create migration guides for teams using the library
- Implement Composite and Machine in new structure
- Implement core components in the new package structure
- Create test infrastructure for the S8r framework
- Create comprehensive BDD tests for the S8r framework
- Implement automated documentation generation system (Phases 1-5 complete)
- Implement documentation CI integration with pre-release checks
- Test the new Maven structure end-to-end with validation scripts
- Implement TODO standardization tooling and standards
- Execute TODO standardization across the codebase
- Implement directory flattening to improve organization (Phases 1-5 complete)
- Standardize test tags and organization (98% complete, applied across all test files)
- Complete research document on AI-enhanced testing strategies (see /docs/research/test-in-age-of-ai.md)
- Complete package-info.java files for all packages (57/57 packages, 100% complete)
- Refactor initialization package into Clean Architecture (application, infrastructure, adapter layers)
- Refactor adapter layer to use reflection instead of direct dependencies on legacy code
- Implement hierarchical event propagation in InMemoryEventDispatcher
- Fix event naming conventions and support backward compatibility during migration
- Update test infrastructure to work with hierarchical event propagation
- Fix Clean Architecture compliance issues (100% complete, verified by tests)
- Create port-interface-test-plan.md with comprehensive TDD approach
- Implement following port interfaces using TDD approach:
  - FileSystemPort and StandardFileSystemAdapter
  - CachePort and InMemoryCacheAdapter
  - MessagingPort and InMemoryMessagingAdapter
  - TaskExecutionPort and ThreadPoolTaskExecutionAdapter
  - SecurityPort and InMemorySecurityAdapter
  - StoragePort and InMemoryStorageAdapter
  - TemplatePort and FreemarkerTemplateAdapter
  - NotificationPort and NotificationAdapter (with email, SMS, and push notifications)
- Create service classes for all port interfaces with proper error handling and asynchronous operations
- Implement unit tests for all port interfaces testing contract compliance
- Implement service-level tests with mocked ports
- Create Cucumber feature for NotificationPort end-to-end testing
- Implement NotificationPortSteps for BDD testing
