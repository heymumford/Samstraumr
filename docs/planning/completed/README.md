# Completed Planning Documents

This directory previously contained planning documents for completed tasks and initiatives. All completed planning documents have been moved to the `/docs/planning/archived` directory with the `archived-` prefix to maintain a clean and organized structure.

## Finding Archived Documents

To locate specific archived documents, please:

1. Check the `/docs/planning/archived` directory
2. Refer to the [plan-status.md](../plan-status.md) document for a comprehensive list of all archived documents
3. Use the archive date in the document name to identify when the document was archived

## Archiving Process

When a planning document is marked as completed:

1. It is moved from its original location to the `/docs/planning/archived` directory
2. The filename is prefixed with `archived-` to clearly indicate its status
3. The entry in plan-status.md is updated to reflect the new location
4. Cross-references in other documents are updated to point to the new location

## Restoration Policy

If a completed plan needs to be revived due to additional work required:

1. Create a new planning document rather than restoring the archived version
2. Reference the archived document as needed for historical context
3. Update the plan-status.md document to reflect the new planning document

This approach ensures a clean audit trail of planning documents and maintains the integrity of the document history.
