# Test Refactoring Summary

## Achievements

1. **Enhanced Common Libraries**
   - Added standardized build and test functions to `common.sh`
   - Implemented `parse_args`, `build_maven_command`, `run_test_with_status`, and `print_test_status` functions
   - Enhanced `test-lib.sh` with a unified `run_test` function

2. **Created Unified Test Runner**
   - Implemented `unified-test-runner.sh` that replaces separate test execution scripts
   - Added command-line argument handling with unified parameter processing
   - Used enhanced libraries for consistent behavior across all test types

3. **ATL Test Integration**
   - Added special handling for ATL tests by delegating to the specialized `run-atl-tests.sh` script
   - Fixed issues with local variable declarations in pipe subprocesses
   - Ensured correct working directory and command-line parameter passing

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` documentation with new options and examples
   - Improved descriptions of test command behavior

## Current State

1. **Regular Test Types (unit, tube, flow, etc.)**
   - Working correctly through unified test runner
   - Support inclusive testing with `--both` flag for equivalent test types

2. **Special Test Types (ATL, BTL, adam)**
   - ATL tests: Integration working, but test discovery issue remains unresolved
   - BTL tests: Disabled in project but integrated into unified interface
   - Adam tube tests: Specialized handling implemented

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Test Discovery Issue**
   - Investigate Maven test discovery for ATL tests
   - Possible focus areas:
     - JUnit Platform configuration
     - Cucumber feature file paths
     - Test class visibility

2. **Additional Improvements**
   - Consolidate other test scripts into the unified framework
   - Add more comprehensive test status reporting
   - Consider adding test selection by tag or feature

## Conclusion

The unified test runner now provides a consistent interface for all test types, making it easier to maintain and extend. The special test types like ATL, BTL, and adam tests are handled with their specific requirements through the same interface, promoting a consistent user experience.

The implementation follows best practices such as:
- Using associative arrays for standardized argument parsing
- Creating a centralized Maven command builder for consistency
- Using a unified approach to test execution and reporting
- Special handling for test types that don't use Cucumber tags
