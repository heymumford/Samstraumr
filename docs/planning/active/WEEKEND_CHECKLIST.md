## REMEMBER

- **Boundaries are rigid**: Success criteria, budget, quality threshold, timeline
- **Autonomy is flexible**: How you achieve them is up to you + team
- **Learn as you go**: Document what works, what doesn't, for Phase 2
- **You own this**: Not following a script, making conscious decisions

This weekend's validation work is the difference between 10.7% success (blind execution) and 85% success (informed execution).

**Go validate.**
