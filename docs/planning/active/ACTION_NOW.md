# PHASE 1: ACTION NOW (Immediate Next Steps)

**Status: YELLOW** → Proceed IF conditions are met by Sunday. Otherwise defer to Feb 18.

**Time to decision: 48 hours** (not 5.5 days)

---

## CRITICAL PATH: NEXT 48 HOURS

### TODAY (Friday, 1 hour total)

**Action 1: Finance Pre-Budgeting Check** (15 min, blocking)
- Call/email Finance contact: "Are 4 Samstraumr FTE in the FY2025 headcount budget already?"
- If YES → Proceed (SLA 1-3 days)
- If NO → Escalate to Executive Sponsor immediately (SLA becomes 5-10 days, timeline shifts)
- **This decision gates everything**

**Action 2: Warm Candidate Check** (15 min, planning)
- Do you have warm intros to ANY of these 3+ consciousness research labs?
  - Araya Inc (Tokyo)
  - University of Sussex AI Consciousness Group
  - University College London (Steve Fleming lab)
- If YES to 3+ lab contacts → Can reach 15 candidates in 2-3 days
- If NO → Must do cold outreach (risky, timeline extends)

**Action 3: Delegate Check** (15 min, capacity)
- Can you make 4 hiring decisions in 48 hours without fatigue regret (18-25% regret rate in research)?
- If YES → Do all 4
- If NO or MAYBE → Identify 1-2 trusted lieutenants for final decision power on Roles 3-4 (engineers, data scientists, etc.)

**Action 4: Team Alignment Scheduling** (15 min)
- Schedule 30-min call for TOMORROW (Sat or Sun) with hiring team
- Agenda: Lock 3 things (decision authority, shared scorecard, interview design)

---

### SATURDAY (2 hours total, parallel)

**If Finance = YES + Warm pipeline VIABLE:**

- 1h: Warm outreach to 3+ consciousness lab directors
  - Message: "Hiring data scientist/experimentalist for consciousness research sprint (Feb 17 start, $3K/wk, 20 weeks). Want to recommend anyone?"
  - Goal: 15+ confirmed interests by Sunday EOD

- 1h: Team alignment call (Saturday or move to Sunday if conflict)
  - Lock: Decision authority (who decides for Roles 1-4?)
  - Lock: Shared scorecard (same rubric, same criteria for all)
  - Lock: Interview design (who interviews when, what do they assess?)

**If Finance = NO or Warm pipeline NOT VIABLE:**
- Skip to "DEFER to Feb 18" section below

---

### SUNDAY (1 hour total)

- **Count results**: 15+ warm candidates confirmed? Team aligned? Decision authority clear?

---

## SUNDAY EVENING: GO/DEFER DECISION

**GO (Proceed Feb 10-14)**:
- ✅ Finance: Pre-budgeted (SLA 1-3 days)
- ✅ Warm candidates: 15+ interested
- ✅ Team: Aligned on scorecard + authority + interview process
- ✅ Your capacity: Can do 4 decisions OR have 1-2 trusted delegates
- **Status: YELLOW → GREEN**
- **Confidence: 85%**

**DEFER to Feb 18** (Use Feb 10-17 for prep):
- ❌ Finance: Not pre-budgeted (SLA 5-10 days)
- OR ❌ Warm candidates: <8 interested (cold outreach too risky)
- OR ❌ Team: Alignment call revealed major disagreements
- OR ❌ Your capacity: Cannot realistically do 4 decisions + fatigue risk
- **Status: YELLOW → RED**
- **Confidence: 75-85% (better to defer prepared than execute blind)**

**Announce decision by Sunday 6 PM** to Executive Sponsor + team (one sentence: "GO Feb 10" or "DEFER to Feb 18").

---

## IF GO (Feb 10-14 Execution)

**Monday Feb 10, 8 AM:**
- Submit budget approval ($164.1K)
- Call warm candidates from Sat outreach (schedule phone screens for Mon-Tue)

**Mon-Wed:**
- Phone screens (15 min each, 6-8 total)
- Technical interviews (30 min each, top candidates)

**Wednesday evening:**
- Offers made to top choices

**Thursday:**
- Contracts signed

**Friday:**
- Onboarding materials ready
- Week 1 kickoff (Feb 17, 9 AM PT) confirmed

---

## IF DEFER (Feb 18 Restart)

**Use Feb 10-17 to resolve blockers:**

**If Finance blocked:**
- Work with FP&A on headcount approval cycle
- Get Executive Sponsor alignment on timeline
- Target: Approval by Feb 15

**If Warm pipeline blocked:**
- Cold outreach to 50+ candidates in target field
- Target: 15-20 confirmed interests by Feb 17

**If Team misaligned:**
- 3-4 hour planning sprint Mon-Tue
- Lock scorecard, authority, interview design

**If Your capacity blocked:**
- Find 1-2 domain experts for delegation
- Design split decision-making model

**Restart execution Feb 18-22** with validated prerequisites.

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**48 hours to decision.** Not 5.5 days. Not iterations.

Three critical checks today (Finance, warm candidates, delegation):
- **Finance pre-budgeted?** → Gates everything
- **15+ warm candidates reachable?** → Determines sprint viability
- **Decision capacity clear?** → Determines if you go solo or delegate

One 30-min team call (Sat/Sun): Lock scorecard + authority + interview design.

Sunday evening: Announce GO or DEFER.

---

## THE MATH

**GO path: 85% success, Feb 14 done.**
**DEFER path: 75-85% success, Feb 22 done (better to defer prepared).**
**Skip validation: 10.7% success, likely slip to Feb 20-22 (NOT an option).**

**Choose GO or DEFER by Sunday 6 PM.**

---

**You have the framework. You know the decision points. Execute.**
