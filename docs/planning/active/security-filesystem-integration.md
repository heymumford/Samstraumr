# Security Filesystem Integration

## Overview

This document details the implementation of integration tests between the SecurityPort and FileSystemPort interfaces in the Samstraumr framework, showcasing how these ports can work together to provide secured file operations.

## Implementation Details

### Integration test features

The integration tests cover the following scenarios:

1. **Authorized File Operations**:
   - Reading a file with proper authorization
   - Writing to a file with proper authorization
   - Deleting a file with proper authorization
   - Creating a new file with proper authorization
   - Listing directory contents with proper authorization

2. **Unauthorized File Operations**:
   - Attempted unauthorized file read
   - Attempted unauthorized file write
   - Attempted unauthorized file delete
   - Attempted unauthorized file creation
   - Attempted unauthorized directory listing

3. **Multi-User Scenarios**:
   - File access across multiple security contexts
   - Different permission levels for different users

### Architecture

The implementation follows a clean architecture approach:

1. **Port Interfaces**:
   - Extended SecurityPort with resource permission methods
   - Used existing FileSystemPort for file operations

2. **Integration Service**:
   - Created SecureFileService that combines both ports
   - Implements permission checking before file operations
   - Logs access attempts for audit purposes

3. **Security Model**:
   - Added Permission enumeration for standard file operations (READ, WRITE, etc.)
   - Added SecurityContext interface for user/component identity
   - Added AccessDeniedException for security violations

### Key components

1. **Feature File**: `security-filesystem-integration-test.feature`
   - Contains 12 scenarios covering all aspects of secure file operations
   - Follows BDD best practices with clear Given-When-Then structure

2. **Step Definitions**: `SecurityFileSystemIntegrationSteps.java`
   - Implements all test scenarios
   - Creates a test environment with secured files and directories
   - Simulates different user permissions and access attempts

3. **Supporting Code**:
   - Enhanced SecurityPort interface with required methods
   - Updated security adapter implementation
   - Created test utilities for file management

4. **Test Runner**: `run-port-integration-tests.sh`
   - Dedicated script for running port integration tests
   - Makes integration tests easy to run during development

## Benefits

1. **Security Validation**: Tests ensure file operations respect security permissions
2. **Clean Architecture**: Demonstrates separation of concerns between security and file systems
3. **Integration Pattern**: Provides a reusable pattern for securing resources
4. **Audit Trail**: Includes comprehensive logging for security events
5. **Multiple User Support**: Tests differentiated access for different security contexts

## Future Improvements

1. Expand integration patterns to include more ports (e.g., CachePort with SecurityPort)
2. Add performance tests for secured file operations
3. Implement more complex security models (role-based, attribute-based)
4. Support encrypted file operations with security keys
5. Add integration with external security systems (LDAP, OAuth, etc.)

## Conclusion
