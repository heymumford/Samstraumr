# Task Plan: Samstraumr Phase 1-2 Analysis → Agentic Implementation

## Goal
Transform 87 analysis files + 45 research rankings + 100-feature decomposition into executable agent-ready plan structure. Enable solo architect to dispatch agents with full context for 20-week consciousness research program.

## Timeline
- **Phase 0 (NOW)**: Organize files + create persistent planning docs
- **Phases 1-4 (Weeks 1-20)**: Execute 100 features across 4 phases
- **Gate Checkpoints**: Week 4, 8, 12, 15, 20

## Phases
- [x] Phase 0: Recover analysis from 87 untracked files
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-5) — 31 features, 520h, consciousness infrastructure
  - Gate 1 (Week 4): Consciousness formalization falsifiable?
- [ ] Phase 2: Measurement (Weeks 6-12) — 28 features, 450h, cognitive load + recovery baseline
  - Gate 2 (Week 8): A/B test shows cognitive load effect?
- [ ] Phase 3: Experiments (Weeks 10-15) — 27 features, 450h, chaos + recovery validation
  - Gate 3 (Week 12): DDD architecture sound?
  - Gate 4 (Week 15): Recovery ≥70%? [EXISTENTIAL]
- [ ] Phase 4: Publication (Weeks 16-20) — 14 features, 340h, papers submitted
  - Gate 5 (Week 20): All validation complete?

## Staffing Model (20 weeks, 1,760 hours)
- **Eric**: 600h (30 hrs/week) — Architecture, philosophy, papers 41/44
- **Collaborator**: 750h (37.5 hrs/week) — Experiments, measurement, chaos analysis
- **Contractor 1** (Tooling): 100h (Weeks 5-12) — Smart linter, property testing, CI/CD
- **Contractor 2** (Writer): 260h (Weeks 8-20) — Papers 38, 42, 43; documentation
- **Contractor 3** (Data Sci): 50h (Weeks 3-8) — Statistical analysis, ML modeling

**Total Budget**: 1,760h + 240h contingency = 2,000h capacity

## Key Research Priorities (Top 20)
### Tier 1 (MUST-HAVE)
- Rank 36: ConsciousnessLoggerAdapter
- Rank 1: Consciousness Temporal Logic
- Rank 6: Consciousness Separation
- Rank 8: DDD Bounded Contexts

### Tier 2 (SHOULD-HAVE)
- Rank 11, 13, 16, 20, 21, 29, 34

### Tier 3 (GATE-DEPENDENT)
- Rank 26-28: Recovery + Isolation

### Tier 4 (PUBLICATION)
- Ranks 41-44: 4-paper pipeline

## 5 Critical Gates

| Gate | Week | Question | GO | NO-GO |
|------|------|----------|-----|-------|
| 1 | 4 | Consciousness falsifiable? | Proceed | Alternative |
| 2 | 8 | Cognitive load effect? | Refactor | Skip (150h savings) |
| 3 | 12 | Architecture sound? | Experiments | Rethink |
| **4** | **15** | **Recovery ≥70%?** | **PASS** | **MODIFIED/PIVOT** |
| 5 | 20 | All validated? | Submit | Extend 1-2 wk |

**Gate 4 EXISTENTIAL**: Recovery <70% forces narrative rewrites.

## Status
**Currently in Phase 0-1 transition**

- [x] SCM housekeeping: 87 files recovered
- [x] Analysis synthesis: Phase 1 + Phase 2 complete
- [x] Planning-with-files setup: Creating persistent docs NOW
- [ ] Week 0 pre-work checklist
- [ ] Week 1 kickoff

## Documents Reference

**Master Planning**:
- task_plan.md (this file)
- findings_catalog.md — All 87 files cataloged
- feature_tracking_sheet.md — 100 features
- phase_tracker.md — Weekly effort + milestones

**Phase 1 Analysis** (Source Truth):
- FINAL_RESEARCH_RANKINGS.md (45 recommendations)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_ITERATION_3.md (100 features)
- VALUE_FRAMEWORK_ITERATION_1.md (5 dimensions)
- RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_ITERATION_2.md (staffing)

## Next: Week 0 Pre-Work
- [ ] Distribute QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md to team
- [ ] Confirm contractors + sign
- [ ] Import 100 features to Jira
- [ ] Schedule all-hands kickoff
