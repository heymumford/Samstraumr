# Unified Quality Checks Plan

This document outlines the plan to implement a unified quality check system for the Samstraumr project.

## Metadata

- **Category**: Build/CI
- **Priority**: P1
- **Status**: Planned
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Due**: 2025-04-20
- **Issue**: N/A

## Overview

Currently, quality checks are scattered across multiple scripts and configuration files, making it difficult to maintain and ensure consistent quality throughout the codebase. This plan aims to consolidate all quality checks into a unified system that can be run consistently in various environments.

## Current Issues

1. Quality check scripts are fragmented across multiple locations
2. Configuration for quality tools is inconsistent
3. No unified reporting for quality issues
4. Difficult to run all checks with a single command
5. No clear metrics for code quality

## Standardization Goals

1. **Consolidated scripts**: Create a unified script to run all quality checks
2. **Consistent configuration**: Standardize configuration for all quality tools
3. **Unified reporting**: Create a consolidated report for all quality issues
4. **Single command**: Allow running all quality checks with a single command
5. **Quality metrics**: Define clear metrics to measure code quality

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Inventory and Analysis

1. ⬜ Inventory all existing quality check tools:
   - Checkstyle
   - SpotBugs
   - PMD
   - JaCoCo
   - Spotless
   - OWASP Dependency Check
2. ⬜ Analyze current configuration for each tool:
   - Document current settings
   - Identify inconsistencies
   - Determine optimal configuration
3. ⬜ Map current scripts to functions:
   - Identify duplicate functionality
   - Determine common patterns
   - Plan unified structure

### Phase 2: Tool Configuration Standardization

1. ⬜ Create standardized configuration files:
   - Checkstyle: `quality-tools/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
   - SpotBugs: `quality-tools/spotbugs/spotbugs-exclude.xml`
   - PMD: `quality-tools/pmd/ruleset.xml`
   - JaCoCo: Configure via Maven
2. ⬜ Define quality thresholds:
   - Code coverage: Line coverage > 80%, branch coverage > 70%
   - Complexity: Cyclomatic complexity < 15
   - Duplication: < 3% duplicated code
3. ⬜ Create profiles for different quality levels:
   - Standard: Basic quality checks for development
   - Strict: Thorough checks for releases
   - Security: Focused on security issues

### Phase 3: Script Implementation

1. ⬜ Create a unified script structure:
   - `util/bin/quality/check-quality.sh`: Main entry point
   - Modules for each tool/function
2. ⬜ Implement script functions:
   - `check_style()`: Run style checks
   - `check_bugs()`: Run bug detection
   - `check_coverage()`: Run coverage checks
   - `check_security()`: Run security checks
3. ⬜ Add reporting functionality:
   - Generate consolidated HTML report
   - Output summary to console
   - Export results to JSON for CI integration

### Phase 4: Integration

1. ⬜ Integrate with s8r CLI:
   - Add quality commands to s8r CLI
   - Implement standard options
2. ⬜ Integrate with CI pipeline:
   - Add quality check job to GitHub Actions
   - Configure reporting
3. ⬜ Add pre-commit hooks:
   - Run basic quality checks before commit
   - Allow bypassing for WIP commits

### Phase 5: Documentation and Training

1. ⬜ Create documentation:
   - Tool configuration
   - Script usage
   - Quality metrics
2. ⬜ Update CLAUDE.md and contribution guidelines

## Implementation Schedule

| Phase |                Task                | Target Start | Target Completion |    Status     |
|-------|------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1     | Inventory and Analysis             | 2025-04-10   | 2025-04-12        | ⬜ Not Started |
| 2     | Tool Configuration Standardization | 2025-04-12   | 2025-04-15        | ⬜ Not Started |
| 3     | Script Implementation              | 2025-04-15   | 2025-04-17        | ⬜ Not Started |
| 4     | Integration                        | 2025-04-17   | 2025-04-19        | ⬜ Not Started |
| 5     | Documentation and Training         | 2025-04-19   | 2025-04-20        | ⬜ Not Started |

## Success Criteria

1. **Usability**: All quality checks can be run with a single command
2. **Visibility**: Consolidated quality report available
3. **Integration**: Quality checks integrated with CI pipeline
4. **Coverage**: All major quality aspects (style, bugs, security, coverage) addressed
5. **Consistency**: Consistent results across local and CI environments
