Subject: Question: Are 4 FTE Samstraumr Phase 1 in FY budget?

Hi [Finance Director First Name],

Quick question for timeline purposes: Are the 4 FTE headcount for Samstraumr Phase 1 already approved in the FY2025 budget?

If YES → Finance SLA for $164.1K spend request is ~1 day. Perfect.
If NO → New headcount approval cycle (~5-10 days). Need to know for planning.

Can you confirm by tomorrow EOD?

Thanks,
Eric
