# Lifecycle Test Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of P1 Lifecycle Tests for the S8r framework.

## Implemented Features

### Lifecycle Tests

1. **Lifecycle Transitions** (`lifecycle-transitions.feature`)
   - Test component progression through normal lifecycle states
   - Test initialization and termination phase transitions
   - Test state transition event handling
   - Test timer cancellation during termination
   - Test invalid state transition handling

2. **Lifecycle States** (`lifecycle-states.feature`)
   - Test state-dependent behavior for operations
   - Test operation availability in different states
   - Test data processing pause/resume in different states
   - Test configuration changes in maintenance mode
   - Test event handling in different lifecycle states
   - Test component resiliency during state transitions

3. **Lifecycle Resources** (`lifecycle-resources.feature`)
   - Test resource allocation during initialization
   - Test resource release during termination
   - Test resource management across state transitions
   - Test resource limits and constraints
   - Test resource tracking and reporting
   - Test resource handling during failures

4. **Lifecycle Negative Paths** (`lifecycle-negative-paths.feature`)
   - Test invalid state transitions
   - Test operations on terminated components
   - Test initialization failures
   - Test state transition failures
   - Test termination during in-flight operations
   - Test parent-child termination scenarios
   - Test recovery from critical errors

## Implementation Details

1. **Directory Structure**
   - `/src/test/resources/features/L0_Lifecycle/` - Lifecycle feature files
   - `/src/test/java/org/s8r/test/steps/lifecycle/` - Lifecycle step definitions

2. **Step Definition Classes**
   - `LifecycleTransitionSteps.java` - Steps for lifecycle transitions and state management
   - `LifecycleStateSteps.java` - Steps for state-dependent behavior and operation availability

3. **Test Runner**
   - `RunLifecycleTests.java` - Runner for lifecycle tests

4. **S8r Test Script Integration**
   - Updated `s8r-test` script to support the `lifecycle` test type

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all lifecycle tests
./s8r-test lifecycle

# Run with tags
./s8r-test --tags "@L0_Lifecycle"
./s8r-test --tags "@Lifecycle and @ErrorHandling"
```

## Test Coverage

These tests provide comprehensive coverage of the P1 priorities identified in the test implementation plan:

1. **Complete Lifecycle State Progression**
   - Tests for initialization phase states ✓
   - Tests for transition between states ✓
   - Tests for termination phase states ✓
   - Tests for all intermediate states ✓

2. **State-dependent Behavior Validation**
   - Tests for operation availability in different states ✓
   - Tests for data processing enabled/disabled in different states ✓
   - Tests for configuration management in different states ✓
   - Tests for resource allocation in different states ✓

3. **Resource Management Throughout Lifecycle**
   - Tests for resource allocation during initialization ✓
   - Tests for resource release during termination ✓
   - Tests for resource constraints and limits ✓
   - Tests for resource tracking and reporting ✓

4. **Invalid State Transitions**
   - Tests for invalid transition handling ✓
   - Tests for appropriate exceptions ✓
   - Tests for error reporting ✓

## Next Steps

After these P1 Lifecycle tests, the following should be prioritized:

1. **P1: Negative Path Tests** - Implement more comprehensive exception handling tests
2. **P2: Composite Tests** - Create tests for component composition and interaction
