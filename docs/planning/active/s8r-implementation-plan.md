# S8r Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the S8r framework, which is the simplified replacement for the legacy Samstraumr framework.

## Current Status

- ✅ Package structure design complete
- ✅ Core component model implemented
- ✅ Identity system implemented
- ✅ Environment abstraction implemented
- ✅ Logging infrastructure implemented
- ⬜ Composite implementation in progress
- ⬜ Machine implementation planned

## Implementation Strategy

We're following a complete replacement approach rather than adaptation:

1. Create fully functional replacements in the new package structure
2. Remove legacy implementations as they're replaced
3. No adapter pattern or compatibility layers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: core model (completed)

- ✅ Create `org.s8r.core.tube.impl.Component` (replaces `Tube`)
- ✅ Create `org.s8r.core.tube.Status` (replaces `TubeStatus`)
- ✅ Create `org.s8r.core.tube.LifecycleState` (replaces `TubeLifecycleState`)
- ✅ Create `org.s8r.core.tube.identity.Identity` (replaces `TubeIdentity`)
- ✅ Create `org.s8r.core.tube.logging.Logger` (replaces `TubeLogger`)
- ✅ Create `org.s8r.core.env.Environment` (replaces environment functionality)

### Phase 2: composite components (in progress)

- ⬜ Create `org.s8r.core.composite.Composite` (replaces `Composite`)
- ⬜ Create `org.s8r.core.composite.CompositeFactory`
- ⬜ Create basic composite patterns (Observer, Transformer, Validator)

### Phase 3: machine components (planned)

- ⬜ Create `org.s8r.core.machine.Machine` (replaces `Machine`)
- ⬜ Create `org.s8r.core.machine.MachineFactory`
- ⬜ Create machine state management

### Phase 4: test infrastructure (planned)

- ⬜ Complete test annotations in `org.s8r.test.annotation`
- ⬜ Create test runners in `org.s8r.test.runner`
- ⬜ Create Cucumber integration in `org.s8r.test.cucumber`

### Phase 5: documentation & cleanup (planned)

- ⬜ Complete documentation for all new structures
- ⬜ Remove legacy implementations
- ⬜ Update all examples and guides

## Next Steps

1. Complete composite component implementation
2. Implement and test machine components
3. Create test infrastructure in new package structure
4. Remove legacy implementations
