# Readme Implementation

## Overview of Changes

We've reorganized the Samstraumr documentation to create a more structured, comprehensive, and accessible resource. This reorganization includes:

1. **New Directory Structure**: Created a clear, intuitive organization with dedicated sections for concepts, guides, reference material, testing, contribution guidelines, and research.

2. **Enhanced README.md**: Transformed the root README.md into a comprehensive table of contents that explains the purpose, function, and value of Samstraumr to different audiences.

3. **Aligned Terminology**: Ensured consistent terminology throughout, especially in testing documentation, with support for both industry-standard and Samstraumr-specific terms.

4. **New and Updated Content**: Created new content and updated existing documents to fill gaps and improve clarity.
