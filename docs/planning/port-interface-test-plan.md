# Port Interface Test Plan

## Overview

This Test-Driven Development (TDD) plan outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing and testing port interfaces in the Samstraumr Clean Architecture. The plan follows the project test pyramid structure and ensures proper test coverage at each layer.

## Test Pyramid Structure

The test plan follows the standardized Samstraumr test pyramid:

| Level | Tag | Description | Primary Focus |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| L0 | `@UnitTest` | Tests for individual ports/adapters in isolation | Interface contracts, validation, exceptions |
| L1 | `@Component` | Tests for services using ports | Service behavior with mocked ports |
| L2 | `@Integration` | Tests for connecting real adapters with services | End-to-end flow with real implementations |
| L3 | `@System` | Tests for complete system behavior | Multiple ports working together |

## Port Implementation Strategy

For each port interface implementation, the following TDD approach will be followed:

1. **Define Port Interface Requirements**: Document interface requirements, contracts, and expected behaviors
2. **Write L0 Port Interface Unit Tests**: Create tests for interface contract validation
3. **Define Port Interface**: Implement the minimal interface to satisfy tests
4. **Write L0 In-Memory Adapter Tests**: Create tests for the concrete adapter implementation
5. **Implement In-Memory Adapter**: Create the adapter implementation to satisfy tests
6. **Write L1 Service Tests**: Create tests for the service layer that uses the port interface
7. **Implement Service Layer**: Create the service layer implementation to satisfy tests
8. **Write L2 Integration Tests**: Create integration tests combining real adapters with services
9. **Document Port Interface**: Update the port-interfaces-summary.md with implementation details

## Standardized Test Structure

Each test class should follow this general structure:

```java
/**
 * Unit tests for the XxxPort interface and its implementation.
 */
@UnitTest
@Tag("L0_Unit")
@Tag("Functional")
@Tag("PortInterface")
public class XxxPortTest {

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should validate required parameters")
    void shouldValidateRequiredParameters() {
        // Test implementation
    }
    
    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should return appropriate result for valid inputs")
    void shouldReturnAppropriateResultForValidInputs() {
        // Test implementation
    }
    
    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should handle error conditions properly")
    void shouldHandleErrorConditionsProperly() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

## Feature File Template for BDD Testing

```gherkin
@L2_Integration @Functional @PortInterface
Feature: Port Interface Integration
  As a system developer
  I want to use port interfaces for clean architecture
  So that I can keep my application core independent of infrastructure details

  Background:
    Given a clean system environment
    And port interfaces are properly initialized

  Scenario: Basic port operation
    When I perform a basic operation through the port interface
    Then I should receive the expected result
    And the operation should be handled by the appropriate adapter

  Scenario: Port error handling
    When I perform an operation with invalid parameters
    Then I should receive a proper error result
    And the error should be handled gracefully

  Scenario Outline: Port operations with different inputs
    When I perform operation "<operation>" with input "<input>"
    Then I should receive result "<result>"

    Examples:
      | operation | input       | result     |
      | read      | valid-path  | success    |
      | read      | invalid-path| error      |
      | write     | valid-data  | success    |
      | write     | invalid-data| error      |
```

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Unit tests
- Focus on isolated port behavior
- Use mocking for dependencies
- Test all result types and error conditions
- Verify contract compliance

### Component tests
- Test service layer using the port
- Mock the port implementation
- Focus on service behavior and error handling

### Integration tests
- Use real adapter implementations
- Test end-to-end flows
- Verify integration with application core

### System tests
- Test multiple ports working together
- Focus on complete system behavior
- Test with real infrastructure components

## Continuous Integration

All tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with:

1. **Test tags** for selective execution
2. **Code coverage** requirements (aim for >80% coverage)
3. **Automated test execution** in the build pipeline

## Documentation Requirements

For each port interface:

1. **Interface documentation**: Clear JavaDoc explaining the contract
2. **Implementation notes**: Document adapter implementation details
3. **Usage examples**: Provide examples of port usage
4. **Testing guide**: Explain how to test components using the port

## Implementation Priority

Implement ports in the following order:

1. Core infrastructure ports (FileSystem, Logging)
2. Data management ports (Cache, Storage)
3. Communication ports (Messaging, Notification)
4. Security and task management ports (Security, TaskExecution)
5. Auxiliary functionality ports (Template, Validation)

## Conclusion

This TDD plan provides a comprehensive approach to implementing port interfaces in the Samstraumr Clean Architecture. By following this plan, we ensure:

1. Proper test coverage at all levels of the test pyramid
2. Adherence to Clean Architecture principles
3. Well-documented and well-tested port interfaces
