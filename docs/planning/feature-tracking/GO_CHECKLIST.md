```
Call/email Guild Finance contact:

"Hi [Name], quick question: Are 4 FTE headcount for Samstraumr Phase 1 
already in the FY2025 budget, or is this new headcount that needs approval?

If in budget: ~1-2 day SLA for $164K spend request.
If new: ~5-10 day SLA (budget committee review).

Can you confirm today?"
```

**SCORING:**
- 3+ lab directors you know personally = VIABLE
- 1-2 contacts = RISKY (cold outreach needed)

## CHECK 4: Decision Delegation (15 min)

**YOUR ACTION:**
Self-assess (honestly):

"Can I make 4 critical hiring decisions in 48 hours AND feel confident in all 4?"

- [ ] YES → Do all 4 yourself
- [ ] NO or MAYBE → Identify 1-2 trusted people to co-decide on Roles 3-4

**If delegating:**
- Role 1 (Collaborator): YOU decide (most critical)
- Roles 2-4 (Contractors): [Name 1] decides, or [Name 1] + [Name 2] co-decide
