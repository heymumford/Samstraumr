# Phase 1 Prerequisite Validation (Feb 6-9)

**Purpose**: Determine if 5-day sprint (Feb 10-14) is viable. If not, strategically defer to Feb 18+.

**Time Budget**: 5.5 hours concurrent (can parallelize)

---

## TASK 1: Finance Pre-Approval (HIGHEST LEVERAGE — 2.6x multiplier)

**Question**: Are 4 FTE headcount lines in the FY budget?

**Who**: Guild FP&A or Finance Director

**How**: Email + follow-up call (0.5h)

```
Subject: Question: Are 4 FTE hiring lines in FY budget?

Body: Hi [Name], quick question: Are the 4 FTE for [Samstraumr Phase 1] already approved in the FY budget? If yes, finance SLA for $164.1K spend request is ~1 day. If no, will need new headcount approval cycle (5+ days). 

Can you confirm by tomorrow EOD?
```

**Success = YES**: Finance SLA ≤1 day. Proceed with plan.

**Failure = NO**: Finance SLA = 5+ days. Escalate to Executive Sponsor (ask: "Can you override approval by Mon Feb 10, 10 AM?"). If yes, still proceed but acknowledge 1-2 day risk. If no, defer Phase 1 to Feb 18.

**By when**: Mon Feb 8, 2 PM

## TASK 2: Warm Candidate Pipeline (2.05x multiplier)

**Question**: Can I identify 15+ warm candidates for Collaborator role?

**Who**: Your network (colleagues, university contacts, prior team members)

**How**: Network mapping + LinkedIn outreach (3h)

**Day 1 (Fri Feb 6-7, 2h)**:
- Map: List 20-30 people you know in data science / statistics / research (think broadly)
- Reach: Send 15-20 personalized LinkedIn messages or emails to warm contacts
- Message: "I'm hiring for a unique role: data scientist for consciousness research (Feb 17 start, $3K/week × 20 weeks). Interested in chatting? Or know someone?"

**Day 2 (Sat-Sun Feb 8-9, 1h)**:
- Follow-up: Track responses
- Goal: 15+ people who've responded positively or indicated interest

**Success = 15+**: Warm pipeline confirmed. Proceed with plan.

**Partial = 8-14**: Medium confidence. Can proceed but with recruiter backup (shift more sourcing to them). Adjust expectations: may extend to Feb 17-20 completion.

**Failure = <8**: Cold sourcing only. Timeline extends to 2-3 weeks. Recommend defer to Feb 18+.

**By when**: Fri Feb 9, 5 PM

## TASK 3: Hiring Team Alignment (Medium impact)

**Question**: Is the hiring team aligned on role definitions, interview process, and decision criteria?

**Who**: All hiring managers (Eric + others who will interview)

**How**: 30-min alignment call (1h including scheduling)

**Agenda** (30 min):
1. Role definitions (1 sentence each)
   - "Collaborator: Experimentalist who designs measurement systems for consciousness validation"
   - "Contractor 1: Maven/Java tooling engineer who builds smart linters for Clean Architecture"
   - "Contractor 2: Technical writer who can draft academic papers on software + consciousness"
   - "Contractor 3: Data scientist who models recovery dynamics and validates statistical claims"

2. Interview process: Phone screen (15 min) → Technical (30 min) → Debrief (10 min) → Score
3. Decision criteria: What does 3.5/5.0 scorecard look like? (worked example helps)
4. Escalation: If split on a candidate, who decides?

**Success = Aligned**: Team agrees on role definitions + process + scoring. Proceed with plan.

**Partial = Some ambiguity**: Clarify ambiguous roles. May cost 1 extra day in interview loop, but proceed.

**Failure = Major misalignment**: Need 2-3 hour planning sprint before executing. May defer Phase 1 to Feb 18.

**By when**: Mon Feb 8, 10 AM (call completed)

## TASK 4: Hiring Manager Capacity (1.4x multiplier)

**Question**: Can I make 4 high-quality hiring decisions by Feb 13 evening without burnout?

**Who**: You (Eric), self-assessment

**How**: Reflection (0.5h)

**Criteria**:
- **YES**: "I've made 4+ major decisions in 2 days before and felt confident. I can do this."
- **MAYBE**: "I can do it, but it will be tight. I might want a co-leader to help with contractor decisions."
- **NO**: "I typically get decision fatigue after 2-3 big choices. I need 1-2 days between decisions."

**Success = YES**: Keep plan as-is. Eric decides all 4.

**Partial = MAYBE**: Delegate contractor hiring to a co-leader. Reduces Eric's load to 1-2 critical decisions (Collaborator + maybe one contractor). Still proceed with plan.

**Failure = NO**: Shift to 2-week staggered hiring. Proceed with Feb 10 recruiter engagement + sourcing, but target Feb 18+ for final decisions. This is OK; better to avoid fatigue-driven poor hires.

**By when**: Sun Feb 7 (self-reflection, no coordination needed)

---

## GO/NO-GO DECISION POINT (FRI FEB 9, 5 PM)

**Score your results**:

| Task | Result | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Finance pre-approval | YES / NO / MAYBE | ☐ |
| Warm pipeline | 15+ / 8-14 / <8 | ☐ |
| Team alignment | Aligned / Partial / Major gaps | ☐ |

**GREEN (Proceed Feb 10-14)**:
- Finance: YES
- Warm pipeline: 15+
- Team alignment: Aligned
- Hiring capacity: YES
- **Action**: Execute as planned. High confidence (85%).

**YELLOW (Proceed with contingency)**:
- Finance: YES, but warm pipeline 8-14
- OR: Hiring capacity MAYBE (delegate contractors)
- OR: Team alignment partial (clarify, proceed)
- **Action**: Proceed Feb 10, but plan for Feb 17-20 completion. Medium confidence (55-65%).

**RED (Defer to Feb 18+)**:
- Finance: NO (no Executive Sponsor override)
- OR: Warm pipeline <8
- OR: Team alignment has major gaps
- OR: Hiring capacity NO
- **Action**: Use Feb 10-17 for deeper prep. Restart Feb 18 with validated prerequisites. Higher confidence (75-85%).

## Escalation Contacts

If any task returns critical blocker:
- Finance delay → Call Executive Sponsor (cell phone). Ask: "Can we get approval by Mon 10 AM?"
- Warm pipeline shortage → Call external recruiter. Ask: "Can you source + pre-screen 8 candidates by Tue 11 AM?"
- Team misaligned → Cancel Feb 10 launch. Reschedule for Feb 18 after 3-4 hour planning sprint.
- Hiring capacity NO → Find co-leader for contractor sourcing (reduces load).
