# Completed Port Bdd Test Implementation

## Component Repository Port Interface Test Implementation Summary

Date: 2025-04-07

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of BDD tests for the ComponentRepository port interface in the Samstraumr project.

## Implementation Details

- Created comprehensive BDD feature file for ComponentRepository port with the following scenarios:
  - Saving and retrieving a component
  - Retrieving a non-existent component
  - Retrieving all components
  - Finding child components
  - Deleting a component

- Implemented ComponentRepositorySteps to define all step definitions necessary for the BDD tests:
  - Used InMemoryComponentRepository for testing
  - Created mocked ComponentPort for verifying component operations
  - Implemented verification of lineage-based parent-child relationships
  - Added proper test setup/teardown and context management

## Test Coverage

The implementation covers all core functionality of the ComponentRepository interface:
- save() method
- findById() method
- findAll() method
- findChildren() method
- delete() method

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing BDD tests for remaining port interfaces
2. Improve integration between port interfaces through cross-port integration tests
3. Implement comprehensive validation for port interface implementations

## Status

This implementation completes a significant portion of the "Create BDD tests for remaining port interfaces" task from the Kanban board.

## Dependencies

- Requires proper implementation of ComponentId and InMemoryComponentRepository
- Uses the ConsoleLogger for test logging
