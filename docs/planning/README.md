# Planning Documentation

This directory contains planning documents for the S8r framework.

## Test Suite Implementation Progress

We've made significant progress on fixing the test infrastructure for the project. Key accomplishments:

1. Added `Component.createAdam(String reason)` method to support lifecycle tests
2. Extended the NotificationPort interface with missing methods needed by tests
3. Implemented a temporary solution to isolate problematic tests
4. Fixed critical interface inconsistencies in the core framework
5. Created a focused test runner for lifecycle tests
6. Enhanced NotificationAdapter and NotificationResult with all expected methods
7. Updated test files to match our new method signatures
8. Added SUSPENDED and MAINTENANCE states to the component lifecycle
9. Implemented proper convenience methods to support testing

There are still several compilation issues to resolve, but we've made great progress. See the [Test Suite Implementation Report](../../test-suite-implementation-report.md) for details.

## Next Steps for Test Implementation

1. Run the focused lifecycle test to validate our changes
2. Implement stubs for expected component operations
3. Create a test harness for incremental verification of features
4. Focus on critical lifecycle operations first
5. Track and document test coverage systematically

## Core Planning Documents

- [KANBAN](KANBAN.md) - Consolidated kanban board tracking all work items and project status
  - A symlink to this file exists in the root directory for easy access: `/KANBAN.md`

## Strategic Documents

For high-level strategy, see the [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/.md):

- [Strategy](../architecture/strategy.md) - Strategic goals and architectural principles
- [Implementation](../architecture/implementation.md) - Implementation details and code structure
- [Testing](../architecture/testing.md) - Testing approach and implementation

## Working on Tasks

When implementing tasks:

1. Select tasks based on priority (P0 tasks first)
2. Respect task dependencies
3. Update the implementation board as work progresses
4. Add task details to commit messages

## Task Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical - Must be implemented immediately
- **P1**: High - Should be addressed in the current sprint
- **P2**: Medium - Should be addressed in the near future
- **P3**: Low - Nice to have, but not urgent

## Task Categories

- **Feature**: New functionality
- **Testing**: Test improvements or additions
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **Refactor**: Code improvement without changing functionality
- **Bug**: Bug fix
- **DevOps**: Build, deployment, or infrastructure improvements
