# README

This directory contains planning documents for the S8r framework.

## Core Planning Documents

- [Tasks](tasks.md) - Detailed list of implementation tasks with priorities and dependencies
- [Implementation Board](kanban.md) - Kanban-style board tracking current implementation status

## Strategic Documents

For high-level strategy, see the [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/.md):

- [Strategy](../architecture/strategy.md) - Strategic goals and architectural principles
- [Implementation](../architecture/implementation.md) - Implementation details and code structure
- [Testing](../architecture/testing.md) - Testing approach and implementation

## Working on Tasks

When implementing tasks:

1. Select tasks based on priority (P0 tasks first)
2. Respect task dependencies
3. Update the implementation board as work progresses
4. Add task details to commit messages

## Task Priority Levels

- **P0**: Critical - Must be implemented immediately
- **P1**: High - Should be addressed in the current sprint
- **P2**: Medium - Should be addressed in the near future
- **P3**: Low - Nice to have, but not urgent

## Task Categories

- **Feature**: New functionality
- **Testing**: Test improvements or additions
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **Refactor**: Code improvement without changing functionality
- **Bug**: Bug fix
- **DevOps**: Build, deployment, or infrastructure improvements
