# Test Migration Implementation

This document outlines the approach taken to migrate tests from the legacy Tube-based architecture to the new Component-based structure in the S8r framework.

## Overview

The test migration was implemented following a systematic approach that balanced comprehensive test coverage with pragmatic migration strategies. The migration involved converting existing BDD feature files and their step definitions to work with the new Component-based architecture.

## Migration Approach

We used a phased migration approach to convert the tests:

1. **Feature File Migration**: Convert existing feature files to use Component terminology, preserving test scenarios
2. **Step Definition Implementation**: Create new step definitions that use the S8r component framework
3. **Test Runner Creation**: Develop test runners for the migrated test files
4. **Test Annotation Application**: Apply appropriate test annotations for categorization

## Implementation Examples

### Feature file migration

For the atomic identity tests, we migrated from `substrate-identity-tests.feature` to `atomic-component-identity.feature`:

**Key Transformations:**
- Changed "Tube" to "Component" throughout test descriptions and steps
- Updated identity notation patterns from T<UUID> to C<UUID>
- Updated state terminology (e.g., BLOCKED to WAITING)
- Preserved the same test phases and coverage
- Maintained the same scenario structure and verification approach

### Step definition migration

The step definitions were migrated from `SubstrateIdentitySteps` to `AtomicComponentIdentitySteps`:

**Key Transformations:**
- Updated import statements to use the new S8r package structure
- Changed component instantiation methods to use the new Component API
- Updated assertions to verify Component properties and behavior
- Maintained the same test flow and assertions
- Enhanced with additional context and documentation

### Test runner migration

Created new test runners using JUnit 5 and Cucumber integration:

```java
@Suite
@IncludeEngines("cucumber")
@SelectClasspathResource("features/identity/atomic-component")
@ConfigurationParameter(key = GLUE_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "org.s8r.test.steps")
@ConfigurationParameter(key = PLUGIN_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "pretty, html:target/cucumber-reports/atomic-component-identity.html")
@ConfigurationParameter(key = FILTER_TAGS_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "@ComponentIdentity")
@ComponentTest
@IdentityTest
public class AtomicComponentIdentityTests {
    // This class is a test runner, so no implementation needed
}
```

## Test Coverage Verification

To ensure comprehensive test coverage after migration, we:

1. Maintained a 1:1 mapping of scenarios from old to new tests
2. Preserved all positive and negative test cases
3. Maintained the same phase structure (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
4. Updated assertions to reflect the new architecture while maintaining the same verification intent

## Example Files

The following files demonstrate the migration approach:

1. **Feature Files**:
   - Original: `/Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/tube/features/L0_Tube/lifecycle/substrate-identity-tests.feature`
   - Migrated: `/Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/resources/features/identity/atomic-component/atomic-component-identity.feature`

2. **Step Definitions**:
   - Original: `/Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/java/org/samstraumr/test/steps/SubstrateIdentitySteps.java`
   - Migrated: `/Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/java/org/s8r/test/steps/identity/AtomicComponentIdentitySteps.java`

3. **Test Runners**:
   - Original: `/Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/java/org/samstraumr/test/SubstrateIdentityTests.java`
   - Migrated: `/Samstraumr/samstraumr-core/src/test/java/org/s8r/test/runner/AtomicComponentIdentityTests.java`

## Running the Migrated Tests

The migrated tests will be able to run once the S8r framework implementation is complete. Currently, the test structure is in place, but some of the required classes are still being implemented.

Once ready, the tests can be run using the following commands:

```bash
# Test Migration Implementation
mvn test -Dtest=AtomicComponentIdentityTests

# Test Migration Implementation
mvn test -Dtest=AtomicComponentIdentityTests -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@ComponentIdentity and @Phase1"
```

> **Note**: Current compilation errors are expected as the S8r framework components like `Component`, `Identity`, and `Composite` are still under development. The test code serves as a specification for how these components should behave when implemented.

## Next Steps

The following test categories still need migration:

1. **Lifecycle Tests**: Migrating the remaining lifecycle state tests
2. **Composite Tests**: Migrating composite interaction tests
3. **Machine Tests**: Migrating machine orchestration and communication tests
4. **System Tests**: Migrating end-to-end system tests

## Conclusion

The test migration implementation demonstrates a structured approach to migrating tests from the legacy Tube architecture to the new Component architecture. This approach ensures we maintain comprehensive test coverage while adopting the new framework's terminology and APIs.
