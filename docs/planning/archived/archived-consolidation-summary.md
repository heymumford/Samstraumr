# Consolidation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the consolidation work performed to clean up duplicate, temporary, and redundant files in the Samstraumr repository.

## 1. Temporary and Redundant Files

### Removed/consolidated files
- Removed redundant `update_headers.sh` (replaced by `update-standardized-headers.sh`)
- Archived completed migration scripts (`migrate-packages.sh`, `migrate-packages-v2.sh`) 
- Removed empty temporary files

### Created unified libraries
- Created header library at `./util/lib/header-lib.sh` to centralize header update functionality

## 2. Documentation Consolidation

### Canonical documentation files
- Folder Structure: `./docs/reference/folder-structure.md`
- Testing Strategy: `./docs/testing/testing-strategy.md`
- Java Standards: `./docs/reference/standards/java-naming-standards.md`
- Documentation Standards: `./docs/reference/standards/documentation-standards.md`
- Logging Standards: `./docs/reference/standards/logging-standards.md`

### Documentation structure
- Updated `./docs/README.md` with clear documentation structure and canonical file locations
- Added redirect notices to non-canonical documentation files

## 3. Header Script Consolidation

### Canonical header scripts
- Main Header Script: `./update-standardized-headers.sh`
- Header Library: `./util/lib/header-lib.sh`
- S8r-Compatible Script: `./util/bin/update-headers.sh`

### Redirected scripts
- Redirected various duplicate header scripts to the canonical versions
- Created clear redirect notices so references continue to work

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. Improved maintainability by eliminating duplication
2. Reduced confusion by establishing canonical file locations
3. Better organization of documentation with clear structure
4. Streamlined script structure with libraries and redirects
5. Automated header management with standardized templates

## Next Steps

- Review all changes to ensure functionality is preserved
- Run tests to validate changes
- Consider removing the consolidation scripts once verified
- Update any documentation referring to old file locations
