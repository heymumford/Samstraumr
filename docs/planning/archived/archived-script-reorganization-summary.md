# Script Reorganization Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the script reorganization effort aimed at improving the directory structure of scripts in the Samstraumr repository.

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Utility Script Organization

The first phase of script reorganization focused on moving utility scripts from the root directory to appropriate subdirectories:

#### Structure and maven scripts

| Original Location | New Location | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| `/maven-structure-test.sh` | `/util/scripts/test/maven-structure-test.sh` | Tests Maven structure compliance |
| `/maven-profile-test.sh` | `/util/scripts/test/maven-profile-test.sh` | Tests Maven profile functionality |
| `/test-maven-structure.sh` | `/util/scripts/test/maven-structure-test.sh` | Tests Maven structure compliance |

#### Architecture test scripts

| Original Location | New Location | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| `/run-architecture-tests.sh` | `/util/scripts/test/run-architecture-tests.sh` | Runs architecture verification tests |

#### Initialization and workflow scripts

| Original Location | New Location | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| `/run-initializer.sh` | `/util/scripts/initialize.sh` | Initializes the project |
| `/trigger-workflow.sh` | `/util/scripts/ci/trigger-workflow.sh` | Triggers CI workflows |

#### Utility scripts

| Original Location | New Location | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| `/update-standardized-headers.sh` | `/util/scripts/update-standardized-headers.sh` | Updates file headers |
| `/use-java21.sh` | `/util/scripts/java/use-java21.sh` | Sets up Java 21 environment |

### Phase 2: S8r Script Organization and Bin Directory Structure

The second phase focused on organizing the S8r scripts into a categorized bin directory structure:

#### Script categories in bin directory

The following structure was implemented in the bin directory:

- `bin/core/` - Core S8r framework scripts (s8r, s8r-init, s8r-list)
- `bin/build/` - Build-related scripts (s8r-build, s8r-ci)
- `bin/test/` - Testing scripts (s8r-test, s8r-test-cli)
- `bin/component/` - Component-related scripts (s8r-component, s8r-composite, s8r-machine, s8r-tube)
- `bin/dev/` - Development scripts (s8r-dev)
- `bin/migration/` - Migration-related scripts (s8r-migration-monitor, s8r-architecture-verify)
- `bin/help/` - Help documentation scripts (s8r-help)
- `bin/utils/` - Utility scripts (s8r-docs, s8r-quality, s8r-version)
- `bin/s8r-all/` - All s8r scripts in one place for convenience

#### Implementation scripts

Two key scripts were created to implement the organization:

1. `cleanup-root.sh` - Cleans up the root directory by:
   - Removing .orig files
   - Organizing version script files (s8r-version, s8r-version-robust, s8r-version-simple)
   - Fixing symlinks to point to the correct locations
   - Removing underscore-based symlinks (s8r_init, s8r_list) in favor of hyphenated versions (s8r-init, s8r-list)

2. `organize-s8r-scripts.sh` - Creates a structured bin directory by:
   - Creating subdirectories for each script category
   - Creating symbolic links from the bin directory to the actual script files
   - Adding a README.md to the bin directory explaining the organization
   - Creating a utility for managing script versions (use-new-scripts.sh)

### Symbolic links

To maintain backward compatibility, symbolic links were created for all scripts that were relocated. This ensures that existing documentation and tooling will continue to work while encouraging the use of the new locations.

### Script Version Management

For scripts with multiple versions (e.g., s8r-build and s8r-build-new), we created a version management utility (`use-new-scripts.sh`) that allows users to:

- List available script versions
- Switch to new versions of scripts
- Switch back to original versions

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Organization**: Related scripts are now grouped together by function
2. **Reduced Root Directory Clutter**: Moved scripts out of the root directory into appropriate subdirectories
3. **Better Discoverability**: Scripts are now easier to find by their function
4. **Consistent Directory Structure**: Follows the established pattern of putting utility scripts in the util directory
5. **Preserved Backward Compatibility**: Existing references and documentation continue to work through symbolic links
6. **Simplified Version Management**: Easier management of script versions and variants
7. **Improved Documentation**: Better organization of scripts with clear README files

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been updated to reflect the new script organization:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reference the new script locations
2. **docs/reference/cli-reference.md**: Added comprehensive documentation about the script organization
3. **bin/README.md**: Created detailed documentation for the bin directory structure
4. **docs/planning/KANBAN.md**: Updated to track script organization tasks
5. **docs/planning/plan-status.md**: Updated to reflect completion of script organization

## Next Steps

1. **Update CI/CD Pipelines**: Any CI/CD pipelines referring to the scripts should be updated to use the new locations
2. **Create Documentation Videos**: Record short screencasts showing how to use the new organization
3. **Add Alias Support**: Consider adding shell aliases for common script patterns
4. **Script Enhancements**: Using the new organization as a foundation, enhance script functionality

## Conclusion

The script reorganization significantly improves the organization and usability of the Samstraumr CLI scripts while maintaining backward compatibility. The structured approach makes it easier for developers to find and use the right scripts, and the comprehensive documentation ensures that users understand the new organization.

This work represents another step in the ongoing effort to improve the structure, documentation, and usability of the Samstraumr project.
