# Repository Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Samstraumr repository to maintain a clean and well-structured codebase.

## Reorganization Actions

1. **Test Scripts Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `test-scripts` directory
   - Moved all test-related scripts to this directory
   - Updated script paths and symlinks
   - Added a README.md to document the test framework

2. **Utility Scripts Organization**
   - Moved utility scripts to `util/scripts`
   - Moved consolidation scripts to `util/bin/consolidation`
   - Organized version and build scripts

3. **Documentation Organization**
   - Moved documentation files to appropriate locations within `docs`
   - Documentation summaries moved to `docs/planning/completed`
   - Validation requirements documented in `docs/planning/active/VALIDATION-TODOS.md`

4. **Cleanup of Temporary Files**
   - Removed temporary files (`stack-trace-output.log`, `push`)
   - Removed backup directories (`tag-standardization-backup-*`, etc.)

5. **Symlink Updates**
   - Created/updated symlinks to maintain compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: The repository root is now cleaner and contains only essential files
2. **Better Organization**: Files are organized by purpose and function
3. **Improved Documentation**: Each component has clear documentation
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and update scripts and test files

## Validation Tests

As part of this cleanup effort, we've also created comprehensive acceptance tests that document validation requirements for the system:

- Exit code consistency tests
- Component/tube validation tests
- Composite validation tests
- Machine validation tests
- Cross-entity validation tests
- Error handling tests

These tests serve as both documentation of requirements and verification that they've been implemented correctly. Many of these tests currently fail, which is expected until the corresponding validation features are implemented.

## Next Steps

1. Fix compilation errors in the Java codebase
2. Implement the validation requirements documented in the acceptance tests
3. Continue improving organization as the project evolves
