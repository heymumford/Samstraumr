# Maven Structure Migration

*Last Updated: April 7, 2025*

This document outlines the plan and progress for migrating the Samstraumr project from the `/Samstraumr/` directory structure to a more standard `/modules/` structure.

## Motivation

The current `/Samstraumr/` directory structure has several issues:

1. It uses capitalized naming which doesn't follow Maven conventions (lowercase with hyphens)
2. It's not immediately recognizable as a Maven modules directory
3. It's inconsistent with the planned migration to "s8r" naming
4. It creates potential path issues with case-sensitive file systems

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation âœ…

1. Update documentation to reflect the new directory structure:
   - Update `docs/reference/maven-structure.md`
   - Update `docs/reference/folder-structure.md`
   - Update `docs/architecture/directory-structure.md`

2. Create the new `/modules/` directory structure:
   - Create the modules directory
   - Copy the core module structure

### Phase 2: Implementation âœ…

1. Update component.core package and classes:
   - Create missing directories and packages
   - Fix package declarations and imports
   - Address build errors

2. Update Maven configuration:
   - Update the root pom.xml to reference the new directory
   - Update path references in pom.xml files
   - Update configuration file references

3. Test the build with the migrated structure:
   - Run clean install to verify the build works
   - Create finalize-modules-migration.sh script to complete the migration

### Phase 3: Documentation and Scripts ðŸ”„

1. Update documentation to reflect the changes:
   - Update folder and package references in markdown files
   - Add migration details to KANBAN.md
   - Create maven-structure-migration.md document

2. Update scripts to use the new structure:
   - Update build scripts
   - Update test scripts
   - Update utility scripts

### Phase 4: Cleanup ðŸ“‹

1. Complete verification and testing:
   - Run the full test suite with the new structure
   - Verify all functionality works as expected

2. Remove the old structure:
   - Backup important files if any remain
   - Remove the old `/Samstraumr/` directory

## Migration Status

  - Script updates: âœ… Complete
- **Phase 4 (Cleanup)**: âœ… 100% Complete
  - Backup creation: âœ… Complete
  - Directory removal: âœ… Complete
  - Build verification: âœ… Complete
