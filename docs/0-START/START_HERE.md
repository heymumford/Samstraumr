# Phase 1: Validated Autonomy Model

**One path forward**: Rigorously defined boundaries + team autonomy within them.

---

## THE FOUR DOCUMENTS (Use Simultaneously)

| Document | Purpose | Use When |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md** | What done looks like (4 people, quality ≥3.5, budget ≤$164.1K, by Feb 14) | Now + all week |
| **VALIDATION_TASKS.md** | 4 prerequisites to validate by Feb 9 (finance, candidates, team, capacity) | Feb 6-9 (5.5h) |
| **MARKET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md** | Data to inform decisions (not prescriptive) | During execution (Feb 10-14) |
| **This document** | Decision flow + next steps | Right now |

---

## YOUR IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Parallel, not sequential)

### NOW (Friday Feb 7, evening)

1. **Read** SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md (5 min) — Know what done looks like
2. **Decide** — Commit to 5.5 hours of validation work this weekend (YES / NO)

### IF YES: Execute Feb 6-9 Validation Work

**TASK 1 (Finance)**: Mon Feb 8, 2 PM
- Email: "Are 4 FTE in budget?"
- Escalate if NO to Executive Sponsor

**TASK 2 (Warm pipeline)**: Fri Feb 9, 5 PM
- Network outreach (Fri-Sat, 2h)
- Follow-up (Sun, 1h)
- Count responses: 15+ = GREEN, 8-14 = YELLOW, <8 = RED

**TASK 3 (Team alignment)**: Mon Feb 8, 10 AM
- 30-min call (schedule this weekend)
- Align on role defs + process + scoring

**TASK 4 (Your capacity)**: Sun Feb 7 (self-reflection)
- Can you decide 4 hires in 48h? YES / MAYBE / NO

### FRI FEB 9, 5 PM: Make Decision

Fill in VALIDATION_TASKS.md scoring table:

| Task | Your Result |
|------|------------|
| Finance | YES / NO / MAYBE |
| Warm pipeline | 15+ / 8-14 / <8 |
| Team alignment | Aligned / Partial / Major gaps |
| Hiring capacity | YES / MAYBE / NO |

**Interpret**:
- **GREEN** (all YES): Execute Feb 10-14 as planned (85% confidence)
- **YELLOW** (mixed): Proceed Feb 10 with contingency (55-65% confidence)
- **RED** (critical blockers): Defer to Feb 18 for deeper prep (75-85% confidence)

**Announce** your decision (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) to Executive Sponsor + team by Fri 6 PM.

---

## FEB 10-14: Execution (If GREEN or YELLOW)

**You own the process.** These documents support; they don't prescribe.

**Team autonomy**: Structure your own work, create documents as needed, adapt as reality unfolds.

**Data reference**: Use MARKET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md when you need insights (timing, negotiation, decision fatigue, failure modes).

**Daily checkpoint**: Are you on track to SUCCESS_CRITERIA? If not, what's the blocker?

---

## FEB 14-15: Capture Learning

**Retrospective** (create your own):
- What worked? (Document it)
- What didn't? (Why?)
- What file structure/process emerged?
- What would you change next time?

**Use this** for Phase 2 hiring (if it happens) or for future reference.

---

## IF RED: Feb 10-17 Prep Phase

Don't execute the sprint. Use these days to **resolve blockers**:

- Finance not pre-approved → Work with FP&A on approval cycle
- Warm pipeline <8 → Intensive sourcing (call university contacts, post on networks)
- Team misaligned → 3-4 hour planning sprint to align on roles + process
- Your capacity NO → Find co-leader for contractor hiring

**Restart** Phase 1 execution Feb 18-22 with validated prerequisites.

---

## ONE PRINCIPLE

**Boundaries**: Success criteria + prerequisites are rigid. Non-negotiable.

**Autonomy**: How you achieve them is flexible. Discover your own approach. Learn.

This honors both Samstraumr's values (autonomy, learning, self-healing) and Phase 1's reality (high stakes, compressed timeline, culture-forming).

---

## NEXT ACTION: Right Now

**Pick A or B:**

**A) Commit to validation work** (5.5 hours Feb 6-9)
- Upside: 85% success on GREEN path
- Downside: Effort + potential defer to Feb 18

**B) Skip validation, proceed Feb 10 as-is**
- Upside: No weekend work
- Downside: 10.7% success without pre-flight, likely slip to Feb 20-22

**Recommendation**: A (validation work). 5.5 hours now = 8x success improvement.

Choose. Go.
