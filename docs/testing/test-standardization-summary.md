# Test Standardization Summary

This document summarizes the work done to standardize the test tags and organization in the Samstraumr project, creating a more consistent and cohesive testing structure.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created a standardized test pyramid tag structure**
   - Defined a clear four-level test pyramid: L0_Unit, L1_Component, L2_Integration, L3_System
   - Created uniform tag categories for test types, feature areas, and patterns
   - Documented the structure in `/docs/testing/test-pyramid-tags.md`

2. **Created tag mapping documentation**
   - Provided clear mappings between legacy and new standardized tags
   - Documented equivalent tags across different taxonomies
   - Created `/docs/testing/test-tag-mapping.md` as a reference guide

3. **Created a tag standardization utility script**
   - Developed `/util/scripts/standardize-test-tags.sh` to automate tag updates
   - Implemented backup functionality to preserve original files
   - Added logging to track all changes made during standardization

4. **Updated the test runner script**
   - Enhanced `/s8r-test` to support both legacy and standardized tags
   - Added support for running tests by functionality, not just by level
   - Improved the help documentation to reflect the new tag structure

5. **Updated example test files**
   - Applied the new tag structure to key test files
   - Demonstrated the correct usage of standardized tags
   - Ensured backward compatibility with legacy tests

## Test Command Examples

```bash
# Run by pyramid level
./s8r test unit
./s8r test component 
./s8r test integration
./s8r test system

# Run by functionality
./s8r test functional
./s8r test error-handling
./s8r test dataflow
./s8r test state

# Run with specific tag combinations
./s8r test --tags "@L1_Component and @DataFlow"
./s8r test --tags "@Functional and @Pipeline"
./s8r test --tags "@Identity and not @ErrorHandling"

# Legacy compatibility
./s8r test atl       # Maps to functional
./s8r test btl       # Maps to error-handling
./s8r test tube      # Maps to unit
./s8r test machine   # Maps to integration
```

## Next Steps
