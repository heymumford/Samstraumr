# Port Interface Test Report

**Generated:** April 8, 2025  
**Status:** Complete  
**Author:** Eric C. Mumford (@heymumford)

## Overview

This document reports on the implementation status of port interface tests in the Samstraumr project. Port interfaces form the boundary between the application core and external components, following Clean Architecture principles. Properly testing these interfaces ensures that the system maintains proper separation of concerns and allows for infrastructure components to be swapped without affecting application behavior.

## Test Quality Assessment

Port interface tests follow these key principles:

1. **Clean Architecture Compliance**: Tests verify that ports provide a clean boundary between application and infrastructure.
2. **Behavior-Driven**: Tests use Cucumber BDD to ensure clear understanding of expected behavior.
3. **Contract Validation**: Tests verify that both the port interface and its adapters fulfill the contract.
4. **Isolated Testing**: Port tests evaluate each port in isolation to identify interface issues.
5. **Integration Testing**: Integration tests verify port interoperability in common scenarios.
