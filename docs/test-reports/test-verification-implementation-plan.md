# Test Suite Verification Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to complete the "Perform full test suite verification" task from Phase 4 of the S8r Migration Roadmap.

## Current Status

Based on initial analysis using `verify-test-suite` and `analyze-test-coverage`, we've identified the following issues:

1. **Feature Files**: 16/143 feature files are missing standard level tags (88% compliance)
2. **Step Definitions**: Several step definitions are missing, particularly for lifecycle tests
3. **Test Runners**: Configuration for test runners needs verification
4. **Test Coverage**: Coverage analysis tool needs fixing before we can assess coverage

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Fix Verification Tools

- [x] Fix syntax errors in `analyze-test-coverage` script
- [ ] Update `verify-test-suite` to correctly handle function tags

### 2. Standardize Feature Files

- [x] Fix missing standard level tags (@L0, @L1, etc.)
- [ ] Add missing function tags (@Functional, @Lifecycle, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure all feature files follow naming conventions

### 3. Implement Missing Step Definitions

- [ ] Create `org.s8r.test.steps.lifecycle.LifecycleSteps` class 
- [ ] Implement early conception phase step definitions
- [ ] Implement lifecycle test step definitions
- [ ] Create mock implementations for testing where needed

### 4. Fix Test Runners

- [ ] Verify/create `RunLifecycleTests` runner
- [ ] Ensure all runners use correct Cucumber configuration
- [ ] Update test glue code references if needed

### 5. Improve Test Coverage

- [ ] Run coverage analysis after fixing tools
- [ ] Identify packages below minimum threshold (80%)
- [ ] Create additional tests for low-coverage areas
- [ ] Verify coverage meets standards

### 6. Create Verification Reports

- [ ] Generate comprehensive test verification report
- [ ] Generate coverage analysis report
- [ ] Document findings and improvements

## Implementation Schedule

1. Day 1: Fix verification tools and standardize feature files
2. Day 2: Implement step definitions for lifecycle tests
3. Day 3: Fix test runners and verify test execution
4. Day 4: Improve test coverage and create verification reports

## Success Criteria

- All feature files have proper tags (100% compliance)
- All step definitions are implemented (0 undefined steps)
- All test runners are properly configured
- Test coverage exceeds 80% overall
- Comprehensive reports are generated
