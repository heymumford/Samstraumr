### EnhancedInMemoryCacheAdapter

The EnhancedInMemoryCacheAdapter improves on the basic InMemoryCacheAdapter by implementing:

2. **LRU Eviction**
   - Tracks last access time for each entry
   - Evicts least recently used entries when cache is full
   - Maintains optimal memory usage

3. **Concurrent Access**
   - Uses ReentrantReadWriteLock for thread safety
   - Implements separate locks for different cache regions
   - Optimizes read vs. write lock acquisition

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Tracks hits, misses, puts, removes, and evictions

## Usage Guidelines

These optimized adapters should be used when:

1. **High Performance is Critical**: Use in performance-sensitive contexts where every millisecond counts.
2. **Concurrent Access is Common**: Ideal for multi-threaded environments with high concurrency.
3. **Resource Optimization is Needed**: When memory and CPU efficiency are important considerations.

However, be aware that these optimizations come with increased complexity. For simpler use cases or testing environments, the standard adapters may be more appropriate.

## Integration with CI/CD

The optimized implementations have been integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Performance Testing**: Automated performance tests compare optimized vs. standard implementations.
2. **Regression Prevention**: Performance thresholds prevent degradations from being merged.
3. **Metrics Tracking**: Historical performance data is tracked over time to identify trends.

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Optimizations**: Implement similar optimizations for remaining port interfaces.
2. **Load Testing**: Conduct extended load tests to verify stability under sustained usage.
3. **Profiling**: Use advanced profiling tools to identify additional optimization opportunities.
4. **Documentation**: Enhance documentation with detailed performance characteristics and usage guidelines.
