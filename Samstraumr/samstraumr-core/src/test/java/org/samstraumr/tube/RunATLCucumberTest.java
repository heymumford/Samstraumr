/**
 * Test runner for ATL (critical) BDD tests.
 *
 * <p>ATL tests are critical tests that MUST pass with every build. They have the following
 * characteristics:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Fast - They execute quickly to provide immediate feedback
 *   <li>Reliable - They produce consistent results without flakiness
 *   <li>Critical - They verify core functionality essential to the system
 *   <li>High Priority - They block the build if failing
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This runner is designed to be used in the main build pipeline to provide immediate feedback on
 * critical issues. Currently, it serves as a placeholder until the feature files are properly formatted.
