 * <p>Infancy tests verify the basic functioning and interaction capabilities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Full component functionality
 *   <li>Basic interaction with other components
 *   <li>Simple environmental response
 *   <li>Initial data processing capabilities
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Infancy is the third phase in the biological lifecycle model used in the testing
