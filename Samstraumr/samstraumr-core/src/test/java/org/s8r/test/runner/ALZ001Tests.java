/**
 * Test runner for ALZ001 tests focused on Alzheimer's disease modeling.
 * 
 * <p>This test runner executes the Cucumber feature tests for verifying
 * the ALZ001 scientific modeling capabilities in the Samstraumr project. 
 * It uses the ALZ001 tag to filter for the relevant feature files.
 * 
 * <p>The tests validate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Protein expression modeling</li>
 *   <li>Neuronal network simulation</li>
 *   <li>Time series analysis</li>
 *   <li>Environmental factor integration</li>
 *   <li>Predictive disease modeling</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The ALZ001 test suite covers the full spectrum of the testing pyramid,
 * from individual components to complete system integration.
