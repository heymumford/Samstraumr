/**
 * Provides test context classes for managing state in Cucumber BDD tests.
 * 
 * <p>This package contains classes that implement the Context Object pattern for
 * Cucumber BDD tests in the S8r framework. These classes maintain state between
 * step definitions, allowing different step classes to share data during test execution.
 * 
 * <p>The primary class in this package is {@link org.s8r.test.cucumber.context.TestContext},
 * which provides storage and management for components, composites, machines, and other
 * test-related objects.
 * 
 * <p>Context objects are typically:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Created at the start of a scenario
 *   <li>Shared among step definition classes using dependency injection
 *   <li>Used to store and retrieve objects during the scenario
 *   <li>Cleaned up at the end of the scenario
 * </ul>
