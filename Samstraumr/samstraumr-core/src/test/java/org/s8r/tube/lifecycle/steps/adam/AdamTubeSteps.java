 * Step definitions for the Adam Tube concept in Cucumber BDD tests.
 *
 * This class contains step definitions for testing the Adam Tube concept, which represents
 * the first tube created in a system with no parent. These tests validate the properties,
 * constraints, and behaviors of Adam Tubes as origin points in tube hierarchies.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Validation of Adam Tube creation and identification
 * - Testing of hierarchical address format for root-level tubes
 * - Verification of parent-child relationships from origin tubes
 * - Constraint validation to prevent invalid Adam Tube configurations
 * - Descendant tracking capabilities from origin tubes
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * // In feature file:
 * Scenario: Origin tube is correctly identified as an Adam tube
 *   When an origin tube is created without a parent
 *   Then the tube should be identified as an Adam tube
 * ```
