@L3_System @Security @Functional
Feature: System Security
  As a system administrator
  I want to verify that the system implements proper security measures
  So that I can ensure data protection and regulatory compliance

  Background:
    Given a secure system environment
    And security monitoring is enabled

  @Security @Functional @Identity
  Scenario: System should authenticate access to protected resources
    Given a system with authentication requirements
    When a client attempts to access a protected resource
    Then the system should require proper authentication
    And unauthenticated access attempts should be denied
    And authentication failures should be logged
    And repeated failures should trigger security alerts

  @Security @Functional @Configuration
  Scenario: System should enforce proper authorization for operations
    Given a system with multiple permission levels
    And a user with limited permissions
    When the user attempts to perform operations requiring elevated permissions
    Then the unauthorized operations should be denied
    And authorized operations should proceed normally
    And authorization decisions should be logged
    And security violations should be reported

  @Security @DataFlow @Pipeline
  Scenario: System should protect sensitive data throughout processing
    Given a system processing data with different sensitivity levels
    When sensitive data flows through the processing pipeline
    Then sensitive data should be properly protected at rest
    And sensitive data should be protected in transit
    And access to sensitive data should be restricted
    And data handling should comply with protection policies

  @Security @Connection @Functional
  Scenario: System components should communicate securely
    Given a distributed system with components in different security domains
    When components communicate across domain boundaries
    Then all communication should be encrypted
    And components should validate the authenticity of peers
    And communication channels should be protected against tampering
    And secure communication protocols should be used consistently

  @Security @Monitoring @Functional
  Scenario: System should maintain comprehensive security audit logs
    Given a system with security audit logging enabled
    When security-relevant events occur
    Then each event should be recorded in the audit log
    And audit logs should include required details about each event
    And audit logs should be protected against tampering
    And audit log retention policies should be enforced

  @Security @Configuration @Functional
  Scenario: System should maintain proper isolation between tenants
    Given a multi-tenant system configuration
    When multiple tenants are processing data simultaneously
    Then each tenant's data should be isolated
    And tenant boundaries should be enforced at all processing stages
    And one tenant should not be able to access another tenant's resources
    And tenant isolation should persist through system components

  @Security @Resilience @Functional
  Scenario: System should be resilient against known security vulnerabilities
    Given a system with security vulnerability scanning enabled
    When the system is scanned for known vulnerabilities
    Then no critical or high-severity vulnerabilities should be present
    And dependency vulnerabilities should be mitigated
    And secure coding practices should be verified
    And security configuration should meet baseline standards

  @Security @ErrorHandling @Resilience
  Scenario: System should support security incident detection and response
    Given a system with security monitoring capabilities
    When a simulated security incident occurs
    Then the system should detect the security anomaly
    And appropriate alerts should be generated
    And the security incident should be logged with details
    And the system should support investigation of the incident
    And containment measures should be available to limit impact
