@L3_System @Reliability
Feature: System Reliability
  As a system operator
  I want to verify that the system operates reliably under various conditions
  So that I can ensure robust performance in production environments

  Background:
    Given a clean system environment
    And a system with multiple interconnected machines is deployed

  @Reliability @FaultTolerance
  Scenario: System should continue functioning with partial component failures
    Given a system with redundant components
    When 30% of processing components fail
    Then the system should detect the failures
    And the system should reallocate processing to available components
    And throughput should degrade gracefully
    And no data should be lost during the reallocation
    And system monitoring should report accurate health status

  @Reliability @DataIntegrity
  Scenario: System should maintain data integrity during component failures
    Given a data processing pipeline with guaranteed delivery
    When a component fails during processing of a critical transaction
    Then the transaction should be properly rolled back
    And affected data should be reprocessed when the component recovers
    And the system should maintain consistency guarantees
    And downstream components should not receive partial results

  @Reliability @ResourceExhaustion
  Scenario: System should handle resource exhaustion gracefully
    Given a system with constrained resources
    When the system approaches resource limits
    Then the system should apply backpressure to data sources
    And the system should prioritize critical processing
    And the system should release non-essential resources
    And performance degradation should be managed
    And monitoring should alert on resource constraints

  @Reliability @NetworkIssues
  Scenario: System should handle network communication issues
    Given a distributed system across multiple nodes
    When network connectivity between nodes becomes unstable
    Then components should retry failed communications
    And the system should implement circuit breaker patterns
    And local processing should continue where possible
    And the system should reestablish connections when available
    And no data should be lost due to connectivity issues

  @Reliability @CorruptData
  Scenario: System should detect and handle corrupt data
    Given a system processing data from external sources
    When corrupt or malformed data enters the system
    Then the system should detect the data corruption
    And corrupt data should be isolated and logged
    And processing of valid data should continue uninterrupted
    And appropriate error handling should be triggered
    And the system should report detailed corruption information

  @Reliability @LongRunning
  Scenario: System should maintain stability during long-running operations
    Given a system configured for continuous operation
    When the system runs continuously for 24 hours under varied load
    Then resource utilization should remain stable
    And there should be no memory leaks
    And performance should not degrade over time
    And all components should remain responsive
    And system health checks should continue to pass

  @Reliability @StateRecovery
  Scenario: System should recover state after restart
    Given a system with persistent state management
    When the entire system is restarted
    Then the system should reload its previous state
    And all machines should recover their configuration
    And processing should resume from the last saved checkpoint
    And inter-component connections should be reestablished
    And the system should verify state consistency

  @Reliability @Versioning
  Scenario: System should handle component version mismatches
    Given a system with components at different version levels
    When components attempt to communicate across version boundaries
    Then the system should detect version compatibility issues
    And the system should apply appropriate versioning strategies
    And critical functions should continue to operate
    And the system should log detailed compatibility information
    And administrators should be notified of version conflicts
