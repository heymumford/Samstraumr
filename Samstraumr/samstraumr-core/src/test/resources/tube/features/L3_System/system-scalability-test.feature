@L3_System @Scalability
Feature: System Scalability
  As a system architect
  I want to verify that the system scales efficiently under increasing load
  So that I can ensure it meets performance requirements in production

  Background:
    Given a scalable system environment
    And performance monitoring is enabled

  @Scalability @Horizontal
  Scenario: System should scale horizontally by adding processing nodes
    Given a system configured for horizontal scaling
    And the current configuration has 3 processing nodes
    When the system is scaled to 6 processing nodes
    Then processing capacity should approximately double
    And the work should be distributed evenly across nodes
    And system coordination overhead should remain minimal
    And scaling should occur without disrupting ongoing processing

  @Scalability @Vertical
  Scenario: System should utilize additional resources on a single node
    Given a system running on a node with 4 CPU cores and 8GB memory
    When the system is migrated to a node with 8 CPU cores and 16GB memory
    Then processing throughput should increase proportionally
    And the system should utilize the additional resources efficiently
    And performance metrics should reflect the improved capabilities
    And the system should automatically adjust its processing strategy

  @Scalability @DataVolume
  Scenario Outline: System should handle increasing data volumes efficiently
    Given a system processing baseline data volume
    When data volume increases to <scale_factor> times baseline
    Then throughput should scale with an efficiency of at least <efficiency>%
    And resource utilization should increase predictably
    And the system should maintain data processing integrity
    And latency should remain within acceptable parameters

    Examples:
      | scale_factor | efficiency |
      | 2            | 90         |
      | 5            | 85         |
      | 10           | 80         |
      | 100          | 70         |

  @Scalability @Concurrency
  Scenario: System should handle increasing concurrent users/connections
    Given a system servicing 10 concurrent client connections
    When the number of concurrent connections increases to 100
    Then the system should maintain connection integrity for all clients
    And request latency should not increase by more than 50%
    And resource utilization should scale sub-linearly
    And no request timeouts should occur under normal operations

  @Scalability @DynamicScaling
  Scenario: System should scale resources dynamically based on load
    Given a system with auto-scaling capabilities
    And current utilization is at 30% of capacity
    When incoming workload increases to 80% of current capacity
    Then the system should automatically provision additional resources
    And processing should continue without performance degradation
    And when workload decreases, resources should be released
    And scaling decisions should be logged with appropriate metrics

  @Scalability @PartitionTolerance
  Scenario: System should scale by partitioning data processing
    Given a system that processes data that can be partitioned
    When the data volume requires processing to be partitioned
    Then the system should partition the workload appropriately
    And each partition should be processed independently
    And partition boundaries should be managed correctly
    And results should be aggregated properly across partitions
    And the system should be able to rebalance partitions if needed

  @Scalability @ResourceEfficiency
  Scenario: System should maintain resource efficiency while scaling
    Given a baseline system processing 1000 records per second
    When the system scales to process 10000 records per second
    Then resource utilization per record should not increase
    And memory consumption should scale sub-linearly
    And database connections should be efficiently managed
    And the system should minimize redundant operations

  @Scalability @GlobalDistribution
  Scenario: System should support geographical distribution
    Given a system configured for multi-region deployment
    When the system is deployed across 3 geographical regions
    Then processing should be distributed to appropriate regions
    And cross-region communication should be optimized
    And the system should maintain global consistency guarantees
    And latency for region-local operations should not be affected
    And the system should handle region-specific failures gracefully
