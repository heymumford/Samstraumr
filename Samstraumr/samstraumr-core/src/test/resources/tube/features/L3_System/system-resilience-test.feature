# SystemResilienceTest.feature - Resilience Tests for Complete Systems
#
# This feature file contains tests for system-level resilience. These tests validate 
# that complete Samstraumr systems can handle failures, recover from errors, and
# continue operating under adverse conditions.

@L3_System @Resilience
Feature: System Resilience and Recovery
  # This feature validates that complete systems can handle and recover from failures

  @ATL @L3_System @Runtime @Resilience @CircuitBreaker
  Scenario: System recovers from component failures
    # Purpose: Test that systems can detect and recover from internal component failures
    Given a complete system with redundant components is running
    When a critical component fails
    Then the system should detect the failure
    And circuit breakers should isolate the failure
    And redundant components should take over
    And the system should continue operating with minimal disruption

  @ATL @L3_System @Runtime @Resilience @Performance
  Scenario: System handles resource exhaustion gracefully
    # Purpose: Ensure that systems can handle resource constraints
    Given a system is operating under normal conditions
    When available resources become constrained
    Then the system should detect the resource limitation
    And non-critical operations should be throttled
    And critical functions should continue operating
    And appropriate warnings should be logged

  @BTL @L3_System @Runtime @Resilience @Scale
  Scenario Outline: System adapts to varying load conditions
    # Purpose: Test that systems can scale up and down based on load
    Given a system is configured for auto-scaling
    When the load increases to <loadLevel> percent of capacity
    Then the system should scale to <instanceCount> instances
    And performance should remain within <responseTime> milliseconds
    And resources should be efficiently utilized

    Examples:
      | loadLevel | instanceCount | responseTime |
      | 50        | 2             | 100          |
      | 75        | 3             | 150          |
      | 95        | 5             | 200          |

  @BTL @L3_System @Resilience @Awareness
  Scenario: System self-heals after catastrophic failure
    # Purpose: Validate that systems can recover from complete failures
    Given a system with self-healing capabilities
    When a catastrophic failure occurs causing complete shutdown
    Then the system should initiate recovery procedures
    And system state should be restored from safe checkpoints
    And operations should resume in a degraded mode initially
    And full functionality should be progressively restored
