@ATL @L0_Tube @ABT
Feature: TBD Atomic Boundary Testing Example
  # This feature demonstrates the Atomic Boundary Testing (ABT) approach to verifying
  # tube boundaries and constraints according to Tube-Based Development principles.
  # ABT focuses on testing the smallest piece of the system (a Tube), ensuring its 
  # boundaries are properly defined and respected.

  @ATL @L0_Tube @ABT @Identity @Init
  Scenario: Tube boundary test - Identity uniqueness
    # Purpose: Validates that the tube maintains a unique identity boundary
    # This is an "Attle" (Above The Line) test that must pass for the system to work
    Given the operating environment is ready
    When a new Tube is instantiated with reason "ABT Identity Test"
    Then the Tube should initialize with a unique UUID
    And the Tube's identity boundary should remain intact during operations
    And no external system should be able to modify the Tube's identity

  @ATL @L0_Tube @ABT @State @Runtime
  Scenario: Tube boundary test - State containment
    # Purpose: Validates that the tube's state remains within its defined boundaries
    Given a Tube is instantiated and operating normally
    When the Tube processes 10 different data elements
    Then all state changes should be contained within the Tube's boundary
    And the state should only be accessible through defined interfaces
    And the state should not leak to external components

  @BTL @L0_Tube @ABT @Resilience @Runtime
  Scenario: Tube boundary test - Invalid input rejection
    # Purpose: Validates that the tube properly enforces input boundaries
    # This is a "Bottle" (Below The Line) test for additional resilience
    Given a Tube is instantiated with strict input validation
    When invalid data is sent to the Tube
    Then the Tube should reject the data at its boundary
    And log the boundary violation
    And maintain its internal state integrity
    And not allow the invalid data to cross its boundary

  @ATL @L0_Tube @ABT @Flow @Runtime
  Scenario: Tube boundary test - Output constraints
    # Purpose: Validates that the tube's outputs conform to defined constraints
    Given a Tube is configured with specific output constraints
    When the Tube processes various types of input data
    Then all outputs should conform to the Tube's boundary constraints
    And any output exceeding constraints should be contained
    And the boundary violation should be logged
