# Filename: TBD-InterTubeFeatureTest-Example.feature
# Purpose: Example feature file demonstrating TBD Inter-Tube Feature Testing (ITFT) approach
# Goals:
#   - Show proper TBD tag usage for feature interaction testing
#   - Demonstrate testing of internal tube features working together
#   - Provide a template for future ITFT tests

Feature: TBD Inter-Tube Feature Testing Example
  # This feature demonstrates the Inter-Tube Feature Testing (ITFT) approach
  # to verifying how features within a single tube interact with each other.
  # ITFT focuses on the internal collaboration between a tube's components,
  # ensuring they work together to maintain state and process data correctly.

  @L0_Tube @ITFT @Flow @Runtime
  Scenario: Feature interaction - Memory and processing
    # Purpose: Validates that memory allocation and processing features work together
    # This is an "Attle" (Above The Line) test that must pass for features to work
    Given a tube with memory management and processing features
    When the tube processes a large batch of data
    Then the memory manager should allocate necessary memory
    And the processor should use the allocated memory efficiently
    And memory should be released after processing completes
    And the features should coordinate resource usage

  @L0_Tube @ITFT @State @Runtime
  Scenario: Feature interaction - State tracking and reporting
    # Purpose: Validates that state tracking and reporting features work together
    Given a tube with state tracking and reporting features
    When the tube undergoes multiple state transitions
    Then the state tracker should record all state changes
    And the reporting feature should log each transition
    And the current state should be consistently reported
    And historical states should be retrievable for analysis

  @BTL @L0_Tube @ITFT @Awareness @AdaptationTest
  Scenario: Feature interaction - Resource monitoring and adaptation
    # Purpose: Validates that monitoring and adaptation features work together
    # This is a "Bottle" (Below The Line) test for adaptive behavior
    Given a tube with resource monitoring and adaptation features
    When system resources become constrained
    Then the monitoring feature should detect resource limitations
    And signal the adaptation feature with constraint metrics
    And the adaptation feature should adjust tube behavior
    And both features should collaborate to optimize performance
    And the tube should continue operating with reduced resources

  @L0_Tube @ITFT @Identity @Init
  Scenario: Feature interaction - Identity and configuration
    # Purpose: Validates that identity and configuration features work together
    Given a tube with identity management and configuration features
    When the tube is initialized with custom configurations
    Then the identity feature should generate a unique ID
    And the configuration feature should apply settings
    And the tube should be initialized with both identity and configuration
    And the identity should be immutable once configured
