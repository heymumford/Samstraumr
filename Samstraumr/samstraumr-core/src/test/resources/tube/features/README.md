# Adam Tube Core Feature Tests

## Fundamental Principles & Precepts

### 1. Core Philosophy (MECE Framework)

#### 1.1 Tube Identity
- Every tube is a distinct, self-aware entity
- Identity is immutable once established
- Identity includes both static (birth certificate) and dynamic (experiential) components
- No two tubes share identical identity signatures

#### 1.2 Environmental Awareness
- Tubes actively monitor their operating environment
- Resource discovery is continuous and adaptive
- System context is fundamental to tube behavior
- Environmental changes trigger conscious adaptation

#### 1.3 Resource Consciousness
- Tubes maintain awareness of their resource consumption
- Resource utilization is self-regulated
- Resource sharing follows collaborative principles
- Resource limits are respected and adapted to

#### 1.4 Feedback Mechanisms
- All tubes implement internal feedback loops
- Feedback drives adaptive behavior
- Learning is continuous and incremental
- Adaptation preserves system stability

### 2. Working Model

#### 2.1 Operational Assumptions
- Tubes operate in JVM environments
- System resources are finite and measurable
- Environmental data is reliably accessible
- Time is continuous and measurable

#### 2.2 Design Constants
- Birth certificates are cryptographically secure
- Resource measurements are accurate within defined tolerances
- State transitions are atomic
- Feedback loops maintain system stability

#### 2.3 Implementation Requirements
- All operations must be thread-safe
- Resource usage must be bounded
- State changes must be traceable
- Adaptations must be reversible

### 3. Test Framework Goals

#### 3.1 Verification Objectives
- Validate tube identity formation
- Confirm environmental awareness
- Verify resource consciousness
- Demonstrate feedback functionality

#### 3.2 Quality Attributes
- Tests must be deterministic
- Scenarios must be atomic
- Coverage must be comprehensive
- Results must be reproducible

## Core Feature Files

### 1. `tube_creation.feature`
Validates the essential birth process of a tube:
- System environment detection
- Unique identifier generation
- Basic identity formation
- Purpose registration

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario: New tube properly detects system environment
  When a new tube is created
  Then it should record its birth time
  And it should detect available CPU cores
  And it should measure available memory
```

### 2. `tube_awareness.feature`
Tests the tube's basic self-monitoring capabilities:
- Current resource usage tracking
- Memory footprint awareness
- Processing capacity understanding

### 3. `tube_operation.feature`
Verifies fundamental operational capabilities:
- State management
- Basic data processing
- Simple feedback collection

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run all core tests
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@core"

# Run specific feature
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@creation"
```

## Test Design Principles
1. **Start Simple**: Each test validates one clear aspect
2. **Build Up**: Tests progress from basic to complex behaviors
3. **Stay Positive**: Focus on correct behavior first
4. **Maintain Independence**: Each test runs independently

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic creation tests
2. Add awareness capabilities
3. Validate basic operations
4. Document successful patterns

## Note on Scope
These tests focus solely on positive paths and core functionality. Error handling, edge cases, and advanced features will be added in future iterations.
