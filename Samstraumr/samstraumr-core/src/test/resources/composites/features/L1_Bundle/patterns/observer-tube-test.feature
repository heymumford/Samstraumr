# This feature file contains tests for tubes that implement the Observer pattern,
# which monitors signals or operations without altering them.

Feature: Observer Tube - Signal Monitoring
  # This feature verifies that Observer tubes correctly monitor signals without modifying them

  @ATL @L1_Bundle @Runtime @Awareness @Observer
  Scenario Outline: Observer tube monitors signals without altering them
    # Purpose: Verify that observer tubes can monitor signals without modifying them
    Given a monitor tube is initialized to observe multiple signals generated at <signalFrequency> frequency
    And the monitor tube is ready for signal observation
    When the monitor tube observes them
    Then the signals should be logged accurately with <expectedLogCount> entries
    And no modifications should be made to the observed signals

    Examples:
      | signalFrequency | expectedLogCount |
      | high            | 100              |
      | medium          | 50               |
      | low             | 20               |

  @BTL @L1_Bundle @Runtime @Awareness @Observer @Performance
  Scenario: Observer tube maintains minimal overhead during monitoring
    # Purpose: Ensure observer tubes don't impact system performance
    Given a system with active data processing is operational
    And an observer tube is attached to monitor key processing points
    When the system processes a large volume of data
    Then the observer's overhead should be less than 30% of total processing time
    And all signals should be accurately observed and recorded

  @BTL @L1_Bundle @Runtime @Awareness @Observer @Resilience
  Scenario: Observer tube recovers from observation interruptions
    # Purpose: Test observer tubes' ability to handle monitoring disruptions
    Given an observer tube is monitoring a continuous process
    When the observation is temporarily interrupted
    Then the observer should detect the interruption
    And it should log the observation gap
    And it should resume observation when possible
    And it should report the observation interruption
