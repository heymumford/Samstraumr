Feature: Tube Memory Identity - Infancy Phase
  As a system architect
  I want tubes to establish proper memory identity during infancy
  So that they can record and learn from experiences

  Background:
    Given the system environment is properly configured

@Functional  @MemoryIdentity @ExperienceRecording @Positive @Infancy @L0_Tube @State @EpisodicMemory
  Scenario: Record first experiences during infancy
    Given a tube in the "READY" lifecycle state
    When the tube processes its first input
    Then the tube should record the experience in its episodic memory
    And the experience should include input and output details
    And the experience should be marked as a formative memory
    
@Functional  @MemoryIdentity @StatePersistence @Positive @Infancy @L0_Tube @State
  Scenario: Persist state through transitions during infancy
    Given a tube in the "INITIALIZING" lifecycle state
    When the tube transitions from "INITIALIZING" to "ACTIVE" state
    Then the state change should be recorded in the tube's memory
    And the tube should maintain awareness of its previous state
    
@Functional  @MemoryIdentity @AdaptiveLearning @Positive @Infancy @L0_Tube @State @Learning
  Scenario: Begin pattern recognition during infancy
    Given a tube in the "READY" lifecycle state
    When the tube encounters similar inputs multiple times
    Then the tube should begin to recognize patterns
    And the tube should adapt its processing based on past experiences
