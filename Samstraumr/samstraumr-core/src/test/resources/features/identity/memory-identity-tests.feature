/*
Filename: memory-identity-tests.feature
Purpose: Validates the Memory Identity aspects of the Tube Lifecycle model.
Goals:
  - Ensure tubes maintain state persistence across transitions
  - Test experience recording and recall capabilities
  - Validate adaptive learning from past experiences
  - Verify performance awareness and self-monitoring
  - Test purpose preservation during evolution
Dependencies:
  - BDD step definitions in org.s8r.tube.lifecycle.steps package
  - Tube and Environment implementations in org.s8r.tube
Assumptions:
  - Test environment provides stable resource conditions
  - Cucumber test runner is properly configured
  - Test tags are consistent with the test ontology

@L0_Unit @Functional @Identity
Feature: Tube Memory Identity (Psychological Continuity Analog)
  The Memory Identity model ensures that tubes maintain psychological continuity through
  state preservation, experience recording, learning, and purpose preservation. This
  feature tests the aspects of tube identity that correspond to cognitive and memory
  functions in biological organisms.

@Functional  @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @State @S8R_EPIC
  Scenario: Tube maintains state continuity during lifecycle transitions
    Given a tube in the "READY" lifecycle state
    When the tube transitions to "ACTIVE" state
    Then the tube should record the state transition
    And the tube should preserve its previous state history
    And the tube should document the reason for the state change
    And the tube's core identity should remain unchanged

@Functional  @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Experience @S8R_EPIC
  Scenario: Tube records and categorizes experiences
    Given an active tube processing data
    When the tube completes a processing cycle
    Then the tube should log the complete interaction details
    And the tube should classify the outcome of the process
    And the experience should be retrievable from the tube's memory
    And high-priority experiences should be retained longer

@Functional  @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Learning @S8R_EPIC
  Scenario: Tube learns from repeated patterns in experiences
    Given a tube with multiple similar processing experiences
    When the tube encounters a familiar scenario
    Then the tube should recognize the pattern from previous experiences
    And the tube should apply learning from past outcomes
    And the tube should improve its performance for known patterns
    And the tube should track its confidence level in the pattern

@Functional  @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Performance @S8R_EPIC
  Scenario: Tube monitors and optimizes its own performance
    Given an active tube under varying workloads
    When the tube processes a high-throughput request
    Then the tube should collect accurate performance metrics
    And the tube should identify performance bottlenecks
    And the tube should adapt to optimize resource utilization
    And performance history should influence future behavior

@Functional  @L0_Tube @Lifecycle @Purpose @S8R_EPIC
  Scenario: Tube preserves core purpose while evolving capabilities
    Given a tube with a defined primary purpose
    When the tube adapts to new requirements
    Then the tube should maintain its core function immutability
    And new capabilities should align with the primary purpose
    And the tube should reject changes that conflict with its purpose
    And the tube should document how evolution serves its purpose
