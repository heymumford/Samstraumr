# ALZ001 Test Suite

## Overview

The ALZ001 test suite provides a comprehensive testing framework for the Alzheimer's disease modeling capabilities within the Samstraumr system. These tests verify the system's ability to model complex biological processes, analyze temporal data patterns, and predict disease progression for research and intervention planning.

## Test Structure

The ALZ001 tests follow a hierarchical, biologically-inspired testing structure:

### Lifecycle Phases

- **Conception**: Basic initialization and property verification
- **Embryonic**: Component structure and configuration verification
- **Infancy**: Basic functionality and simple interactions
- **Maturity**: Advanced functionality and full integration

### Architectural Levels

- **L0_Component**: Individual component testing
- **L1_Composite**: Integration of multiple components
- **L2_Machine**: Integration of multiple composites
- **L3_System**: Complete system integration

### Critical Path Categories

- **ATL** (Above The Line): Critical functionality tests
- **BTL** (Below The Line): Edge case and detailed behavior tests

## Running the Tests

The ALZ001 tests can be run using the ALZ001Tests runner:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=org.s8r.test.runner.ALZ001Tests
```

To run specific test categories:

```bash
# Run only protein expression tests
mvn test -Dtest=org.s8r.test.runner.ALZ001Tests -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@ALZ001 and @ProteinExpression"

# Run only L0 component tests
mvn test -Dtest=org.s8r.test.runner.ALZ001Tests -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@ALZ001 and @L0_Component"

# Run only maturity phase tests
mvn test -Dtest=org.s8r.test.runner.ALZ001Tests -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@ALZ001 and @Maturity"
```

## Test Implementation

The ALZ001 tests are implemented using:

- **BDD Feature Files**: For scenario definition
- **Step Definitions**: For scenario implementation
- **Mock Components**: For testing without real infrastructure
- **Test Context**: For sharing data between steps

## Dependencies

These tests require:

- Java 21 or higher
- JUnit 5
- Cucumber
- Mockito
- Assertions library
