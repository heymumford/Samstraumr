Feature: ALZ001 - Integrated Disease Modeling Machine
  As a neuroscience researcher
  I want to integrate protein expression and neuronal network models
  So that I can study their interactions in disease progression

  Background:
    Given a scientific analysis environment for integrated modeling
    And a machine configuration for Alzheimer's disease simulation

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize disease modeling machine
    When I create an Alzheimer's disease modeling machine
    Then the machine should be properly initialized
    And the machine should contain the following composites:
      | composite_type          | purpose                                  |
      | protein_expression      | model protein dynamics                   |
      | neuronal_network        | simulate neural connectivity             |
      | time_series_analysis    | analyze temporal patterns                |
      | correlation_engine      | study relationships between components   |
      | visualization           | generate visual representations          |
    And the machine should be in "READY" state

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Configure machine with simulation parameters
    Given an initialized Alzheimer's disease modeling machine
    When I configure the machine with the following parameters:
      | parameter                      | value       |
      | simulation_duration_days       | 365         |
      | time_step_hours                | 24          |
      | protein_sampling_frequency     | 7           |
      | neuronal_assessment_frequency  | 30          |
      | random_seed                    | 12345       |
    Then the machine should be successfully configured
    And the parameters should be propagated to the appropriate composites

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Run integrated disease progression simulation
    Given a configured Alzheimer's disease modeling machine
    When I load baseline patient data
    And I run the simulation with the following progression factors:
      | factor              | influence_strength | temporal_pattern      |
      | tau_accumulation    | 0.8                | exponential_increase  |
      | amyloid_deposition  | 0.6                | sigmoidal             |
      | neuronal_loss       | 0.7                | delayed_exponential   |
      | inflammation        | 0.5                | periodic_with_trend   |
    Then the machine should generate a complete disease progression model
    And the model should include temporal protein expression profiles
    And the model should include neuronal network degradation patterns
    And correlation analysis between protein levels and neuronal function

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Evaluate intervention strategies
    Given a disease modeling machine with baseline progression model
    When I configure the following intervention strategies:
      | intervention            | target_mechanism       | start_day | efficacy |
      | protein_clearance       | tau_reduction          | 90        | 0.4      |
      | anti_inflammatory       | inflammation_reduction | 30        | 0.6      |
      | neuroprotective_agent   | neuron_preservation    | 60        | 0.5      |
    And I run comparative simulations for each intervention
    Then the machine should calculate the effect of each intervention
    And quantify the relative efficacy of different strategies
    And identify optimal intervention timing
    And generate visualizations comparing intervention outcomes

  @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle conflicting simulation parameters
    Given an initialized Alzheimer's disease modeling machine
    When I configure parameters with the following conflicts:
      | parameter                      | value | conflict_reason                         |
      | simulation_duration_days       | -100  | negative duration                       |
      | neuronal_assessment_frequency  | 0     | zero frequency                          |
      | protein_sampling_frequency     | 400   | exceeds simulation duration             |
    Then the machine should reject each conflicting parameter
    And provide specific validation error messages
    And suggest resolution strategies for each conflict
