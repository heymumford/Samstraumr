@ALZ001 @ATL @ProteinExpression @L0_Component
Feature: ALZ001 - Protein Expression Baseline Modeling
  As a neuroscience researcher
  I want to model baseline protein expression patterns
  So that I can detect abnormalities against established norms

  Background:
    Given a scientific analysis environment for protein expression modeling
    And a dataset of normal protein expression measurements

  @Conception @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize protein expression component
    When I create a protein expression component
    Then the component should be properly initialized
    And the component should have protein modeling capabilities
    And the component should be in "READY" state

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Load and validate protein expression data
    Given an initialized protein expression component
    When I load a dataset with the following protein types:
      | protein_type | measurement_unit | normal_range_min | normal_range_max |
      | Tau          | ng/ml           | 80               | 150              |
      | Amyloid-beta | pg/ml           | 500              | 1200             |
      | APOE         | mg/dl           | 30               | 45               |
    Then the data should be successfully loaded
    And the component should report data statistics for each protein type
    And the statistical parameters should include mean, median, and standard deviation

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Calculate baseline protein expression statistics
    Given an initialized protein expression component with loaded data
    When I calculate baseline statistics
    Then the component should generate statistical profiles for each protein type
    And the profiles should include:
      | statistic          | calculation_method    |
      | mean               | arithmetic average    |
      | median             | central value         |
      | standard_deviation | population variance   |
      | range              | min to max            |
      | percentiles        | 5th, 25th, 75th, 95th |
    And the statistical profiles should be stored for comparison

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Generate protein expression time series baseline
    Given an initialized protein expression component with calculated statistics
    When I analyze the temporal pattern over 90 days
    Then the component should identify:
      | pattern_type    | detection_method            |
      | diurnal_cycle   | 24-hour periodicity         |
      | weekly_pattern  | 7-day periodicity           |
      | trend           | slope over entire period    |
      | noise_level     | variance after detrending   |
    And a baseline time series model should be created for each protein type

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Detect natural variation in protein expression
    Given an initialized protein expression component with baseline time series
    When I analyze natural variation patterns
    Then the component should identify normal fluctuation ranges
    And distinguish between:
      | variation_type     | characteristics                         |
      | random_noise       | no temporal structure                   |
      | cyclical_patterns  | recurring patterns with regular periods |
      | trend_variations   | slope changes over time                 |
    And the natural variation model should be available for comparison

  @Infancy @Negative
  Scenario: Handle incomplete protein expression data
    Given an initialized protein expression component
    When I load a dataset with missing values
    Then the component should detect the data gaps
    And implement appropriate strategies:
      | gap_type          | handling_strategy             |
      | isolated_missing  | interpolation                 |
      | consecutive_gaps  | local averaging               |
      | large_gaps        | flag for incomplete analysis  |
    And the component should provide data quality metrics
