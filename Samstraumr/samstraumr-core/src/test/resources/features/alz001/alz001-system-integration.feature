@ALZ001 @ATL @SystemIntegration @L3_System
Feature: ALZ001 - Complete Alzheimer's Disease Research System
  As a neuroscience research team
  I want an integrated system combining all modeling components
  So that I can conduct comprehensive disease research and intervention testing

  Background:
    Given a scientific computing environment for system integration
    And a complete dataset covering multiple patient cohorts over 5 years

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize complete research system
    When I create a comprehensive Alzheimer's disease research system
    Then the system should be properly initialized
    And the system should contain the following machines:
      | machine_type                      | purpose                                         |
      | protein_expression_machine        | model protein dynamics and accumulation         |
      | neuronal_network_machine          | simulate neural connectivity and degradation    |
      | environmental_factors_machine     | model external influences and interventions     |
      | predictive_modeling_machine       | forecast disease trajectories                   |
      | patient_data_management_machine   | manage and analyze clinical data               |
      | intervention_simulation_machine   | test interventions in virtual cohorts           |
    And all machines should be properly connected
    And the system should be in "READY" state

  Scenario: Run end-to-end disease progression workflow
    Given an initialized Alzheimer's research system
    When I execute a complete workflow with the following stages:
      | stage                      | duration_days | parameters                          |
      | data_preparation           | 0             | quality_threshold: 0.9              |
      | baseline_modeling          | 180           | cohort_size: 1000                   |
      | progression_simulation     | 1825          | time_step_days: 30                  |
      | intervention_testing       | 730           | intervention_count: 5               |
      | outcome_analysis           | 0             | significance_threshold: 0.05        |
    Then each stage should complete successfully
    And data should flow correctly between stages
    And the system should generate comprehensive research outputs
    And performance metrics should be collected for the entire workflow

  Scenario: Conduct virtual clinical trial
    Given an initialized Alzheimer's research system with baseline models
    When I configure a virtual clinical trial with:
      | parameter                      | value                    |
      | participant_count              | 2000                     |
      | control_group_percentage       | 30                       |
      | trial_duration_days            | 730                      |
      | intervention_start_day         | 90                       |
      | primary_endpoint               | cognitive_decline_rate   |
      | secondary_endpoints            | protein_levels, neuronal_density |
    And I run the trial simulation
    Then the system should simulate the complete trial
    And generate statistically valid outcome comparisons
    And identify factors influencing intervention efficacy
    And produce virtual safety and efficacy reports

  Scenario: Generate personalized intervention recommendations
    Given an initialized Alzheimer's research system with trained models
    When I input detailed patient data for personalization:
      | data_category                 | elements_count | time_points |
      | genetic_profile               | 50             | 1           |
      | biomarker_measurements        | 20             | 12          |
      | cognitive_assessments         | 10             | 8           |
      | lifestyle_factors             | 15             | 24          |
      | environmental_exposures       | 10             | 36          |
    And I request personalized recommendations
    Then the system should generate a personalized risk profile
    And identify optimal intervention combinations
    And provide detailed timing recommendations
    And rank interventions by predicted efficacy
    And include monitoring recommendations

  Scenario: Simulate disease mechanisms for scientific discovery
    Given an initialized Alzheimer's research system
    When I configure the system to explore theoretical mechanisms:
      | mechanism                          | parameters_to_vary              | simulation_iterations |
      | protein_misfolding_cascade         | rate, threshold, spread_pattern | 100                   |
      | neuroinflammatory_feedback_loops   | trigger_sensitivity, duration   | 100                   |
      | synaptic_pruning_dysregulation     | selectivity, intensity          | 100                   |
      | vascular_contribution              | perfusion_reduction_rate        | 100                   |
    And I execute the mechanism exploration
    Then the system should identify parameter patterns leading to disease acceleration
    And quantify the relative contribution of each mechanism
    And identify potential intervention points
    And generate testable hypotheses for laboratory validation
