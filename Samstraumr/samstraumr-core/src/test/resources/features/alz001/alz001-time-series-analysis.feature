@ALZ001 @ATL @TimeSeriesAnalysis @L1_Composite
Feature: ALZ001 - Time Series Analysis for Disease Progression
  As a neuroscience researcher
  I want to analyze time series data of disease markers
  So that I can understand progression patterns and make predictions

  Background:
    Given a scientific analysis environment with time series capabilities
    And a composite with time series analysis components

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize time series analysis composite
    When I create a time series analysis composite
    Then the composite should be properly initialized
    And the composite should contain the following components:
      | component_type           | purpose                         |
      | data_preprocessing       | clean and prepare time series   |
      | decomposition            | separate trend and seasonality  |
      | correlation_analysis     | find relationships between series |
      | change_point_detection   | identify significant changes    |
      | forecasting              | predict future values           |
    And the composite should be in "READY" state

  Scenario: Decompose disease marker time series
    Given a time series analysis composite with loaded marker data
    When I perform time series decomposition
    Then the component should separate the series into:
      | component     | characteristics                   |
      | trend         | long-term direction               |
      | seasonality   | regular cyclical patterns         |
      | residual      | irregular fluctuations            |
    And provide statistics on each component
    And identify the dominant components by variance explained

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Correlate multiple marker time series
    Given a time series analysis composite with multiple marker datasets
    When I perform cross-correlation analysis
    Then the component should calculate:
      | metric                | description                           |
      | correlation_matrix    | pair-wise correlations                |
      | lag_correlation       | time-shifted correlations             |
      | partial_correlation   | controlling for other variables       |
    And identify statistically significant correlations
    And provide visualization of correlation patterns

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Detect change points in disease progression
    Given a time series analysis composite with longitudinal data
    When I run change point detection algorithms
    Then the component should identify:
      | change_type           | detection_method               |
      | mean_shifts           | CUSUM algorithm                |
      | variance_changes      | PELT segmentation              |
      | trend_changes         | Bayesian change point analysis |
      | correlation_shifts    | rolling window correlation     |
    And assign confidence scores to each detected change point
    And organize change points chronologically

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Forecast disease progression markers
    Given a time series analysis composite with historical data
    When I train forecasting models with the following parameters:
      | parameter           | value          |
      | training_period     | 365 days       |
      | validation_period   | 90 days        |
      | forecast_horizon    | 180 days       |
      | prediction_interval | 95%            |
    Then the component should:
      | output                   | description                                |
      | point_forecasts          | expected values at future time points      |
      | prediction_intervals     | uncertainty ranges around forecasts        |
      | forecast_evaluation      | accuracy metrics on validation period      |
      | feature_importance       | impact of different factors on prediction  |
    And achieve a minimum accuracy of 75% on the validation period

  @Maturity @Negative
  Scenario: Handle non-stationary time series
    Given a time series analysis composite
    When I load non-stationary disease progression data
    Then the component should detect non-stationarity
    And apply appropriate transformations:
      | non-stationarity_type | transformation_method     |
      | trending              | differencing              |
      | heteroscedastic       | log transformation        |
      | seasonal              | seasonal differencing     |
      | cyclic                | fourier transformation    |
    And validate the transformation effectiveness
