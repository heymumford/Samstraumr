@ALZ001 @ATL @NeuronalNetwork @L0_Component
Feature: ALZ001 - Neuronal Network Structure Modeling
  As a neuroscience researcher
  I want to model neuronal network connectivity and structure
  So that I can simulate network degradation in disease conditions

  Background:
    Given a scientific analysis environment for neuronal network modeling
    And a configuration for network simulation

  @Conception @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize neuronal network component
    When I create a neuronal network component
    Then the component should be properly initialized
    And the component should have neuronal modeling capabilities
    And the component should be in "READY" state

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Configure neuronal network parameters
    Given an initialized neuronal network component
    When I configure the following network parameters:
      | parameter                 | value  |
      | number_of_neurons         | 1000   |
      | connection_density        | 0.1    |
      | inhibitory_ratio          | 0.2    |
      | baseline_firing_rate      | 5.0    |
      | connection_weight_mean    | 0.5    |
      | connection_weight_std_dev | 0.1    |
    Then the parameters should be successfully configured
    And the component should be ready for network generation

  @Embryonic @Positive
  Scenario: Generate neuronal network graph
    Given a configured neuronal network component
    When I generate the network structure
    Then a graph representation should be created
    And the graph should have the specified number of neurons
    And the graph should have the specified connection density
    And the neuron types should match the inhibitory ratio
    And connection weights should follow the specified distribution

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Calculate network connectivity metrics
    Given a neuronal network with generated structure
    When I calculate connectivity metrics
    Then the component should compute:
      | metric                    | description                                |
      | average_degree            | average connections per neuron             |
      | clustering_coefficient    | measure of node clustering                 |
      | characteristic_path_length| average shortest path length               |
      | small_world_index         | ratio of clustering to path length         |
      | modularity                | strength of network division into modules  |
    And provide a connectivity profile for the network

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Identify hub neurons
    Given a neuronal network with calculated metrics
    When I identify hub neurons
    Then the component should classify neurons by connectivity
    And determine hub neurons based on:
      | metric           | threshold             |
      | degree           | top 10% by connections|
      | betweenness      | top 10% by centrality |
      | clustering       | local influence       |
    And calculate vulnerability scores for each hub

  @Infancy @Negative
  Scenario: Handle invalid network configurations
    Given an initialized neuronal network component
    When I configure invalid parameters:
      | parameter                 | value   | issue               |
      | number_of_neurons         | -100    | negative value      |
      | connection_density        | 1.5     | exceeds maximum     |
      | inhibitory_ratio          | -0.2    | negative ratio      |
    Then the component should reject each invalid parameter
    And provide specific error messages for each invalid parameter
    And maintain default values for rejected parameters
