Feature: ALZ001 - Predictive Modeling for Disease Progression
  As a neuroscience researcher
  I want to predict disease progression based on multi-factor data
  So that I can develop personalized intervention strategies

  Background:
    Given a scientific analysis environment for predictive modeling
    And training data from multiple patient cohorts

  @Infancy @Positive
  Scenario: Initialize predictive modeling machine
    When I create a predictive modeling machine
    Then the machine should be properly initialized
    And the machine should contain the following components:
      | component_type          | purpose                                      |
      | data_preprocessing      | prepare and normalize input data             |
      | feature_extraction      | identify important predictive features       |
      | model_training          | train prediction algorithms                  |
      | model_evaluation        | assess prediction accuracy                   |
      | prediction_generation   | generate forecasts for new data              |
    And the machine should be in "READY" state

  Scenario: Train short-term progression model
    Given a configured predictive modeling machine with training data
    When I train a short-term model with the following parameters:
      | parameter               | value       |
      | prediction_horizon_days | 90          |
      | training_window_days    | 365         |
      | validation_split        | 0.2         |
      | feature_set             | comprehensive|
      | algorithm               | ensemble     |
    Then the model should complete training successfully
    And validation metrics should include:
      | metric                  | minimum_threshold |
      | accuracy                | 0.75              |
      | precision               | 0.70              |
      | recall                  | 0.70              |
      | f1_score                | 0.70              |
      | area_under_curve        | 0.80              |
    And the model should identify key predictive factors

  @Maturity @Positive
  Scenario: Evaluate long-term prediction accuracy
    Given a trained predictive modeling machine
    When I evaluate the model on test data with:
      | prediction_point | data_completeness | patient_variability |
      | 180 days         | high              | low                 |
      | 365 days         | medium            | medium              |
      | 730 days         | low               | high                |
    Then prediction accuracy should decrease with longer horizons
    And accuracy should correlate with data completeness
    And patient variability should impact prediction confidence
    And the model should provide uncertainty estimates

  Scenario: Generate personalized progression trajectory
    Given a trained predictive modeling machine
    When I input the following patient data:
      | data_category            | completeness | quality_score |
      | demographic              | complete     | high          |
      | genetic_risk_factors     | partial      | medium        |
      | baseline_biomarkers      | complete     | high          |
      | longitudinal_measurements| partial      | medium        |
      | environmental_factors    | partial      | low           |
    And I request a personalized prediction with:
      | parameter                | value       |
      | prediction_horizon_days  | 730         |
      | confidence_interval      | 0.90        |
      | included_factors         | all         |
      | scenario_analysis        | true        |
    Then the machine should generate a personalized trajectory
    And identify critical transition points
    And estimate uncertainty ranges for each prediction
    And suggest key monitoring targets

  Scenario: Handle insufficient data for prediction
    Given a predictive modeling machine
    When I attempt to train a model with insufficient data:
      | data_limitation                | severity    | impact_area           |
      | too_few_patients               | high        | statistical_power     |
      | incomplete_longitudinal_data   | medium      | temporal_patterns     |
      | missing_key_biomarkers         | high        | mechanism_insights    |
      | imbalanced_outcome_classes     | medium      | rare_event_prediction |
    Then the machine should detect each data limitation
    And provide specific warnings about prediction reliability
    And suggest data collection strategies to improve predictions
    And recommend alternative modeling approaches for limited data
