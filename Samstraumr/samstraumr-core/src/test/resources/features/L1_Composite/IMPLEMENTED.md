# Composite Tests Implementation Report

## Implementation Status

The P2 Composite Tests have been implemented according to the test implementation plan. The following components are now available:

### Feature Files
- ✅ **composite-creation.feature**: Tests for composite component creation, hierarchy, and state management
- ✅ **composite-interaction.feature**: Tests for interactions between components within a composite
- ✅ **composite-patterns.feature**: Tests for design pattern implementations in composites

### Step Definitions
- ✅ **CompositeBaseSteps.java**: Base class with shared functionality for all composite tests
- ✅ **CompositeCreationSteps.java**: Implementation of steps for composite creation tests
- ✅ **CompositeInteractionSteps.java**: Implementation of steps for component interaction tests
- ✅ **CompositePatternSteps.java**: Implementation of steps for design pattern tests

### Test Runner
- ✅ **RunCompositeTests.java**: JUnit test runner for composite tests

### Documentation
- ✅ **README.md**: Documentation for composite test structure and usage

## Testing Infrastructure

The s8r-test script has been verified to support composite tests through:
- The appropriate test runner mapping in the script
- Proper tag mapping for composite test selection

## Known Issues

1. Maven configuration issues need to be resolved before the tests can be run. The error "Non-resolvable parent POM for org.s8r:samstraumr:3.0.4" indicates that there are unresolved dependencies in the Maven structure.

2. The mocked implementation classes will need to be replaced with real implementations once the corresponding domain classes are available. The current implementation uses mock objects to simulate the behavior of:
   - Component and Composite classes
   - Event propagation
   - Resource management
   - Various design patterns (Observer, Transformer, Filter, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Resolve Maven configuration issues to enable test execution
2. Replace mock implementations with real domain classes when available
3. Implement remaining P3 tests according to the test implementation plan
4. Integrate tests with continuous integration pipeline

## Summary

The composite tests implementation provides comprehensive test coverage for composite component functionality, including creation, interaction, and design pattern implementations. These tests will ensure that composite components behave correctly as the system evolves.
