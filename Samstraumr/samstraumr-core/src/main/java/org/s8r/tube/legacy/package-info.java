/**
 * Tube legacy package contains legacy tube implementations for backward compatibility.
 * <p>
 * This package provides backward compatibility with older versions of the Samstraumr
 * framework. It contains legacy tube implementations that are maintained for systems
 * that still depend on the original tube architecture but are transitioning to the
 * new component-based architecture.
 * <p>
 * Code in this package should not be used for new development. It exists solely to
 * support migration from legacy tube implementations to the new component architecture.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be removed in a future
 *             version once all dependent systems have migrated to the new component architecture.
 *             Use org.s8r.component instead for new development.
