/**
 * Tube legacy core package contains core legacy tube implementations.
 * <p>
 * This package provides the core functionality of the legacy tube architecture for
 * backward compatibility with older versions of the Samstraumr framework. It contains
 * fundamental tube concepts like Environment, Tube, and TubeLogger from the original
 * architecture.
 * <p>
 * Code in this package should not be used for new development. It exists solely to
 * support migration from legacy tube implementations to the new component architecture.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be removed in a future
 *             version once all dependent systems have migrated to the new component architecture.
 *             Use org.s8r.component.core instead for new development.
