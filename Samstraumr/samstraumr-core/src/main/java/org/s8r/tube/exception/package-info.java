/**
 * Tube exception package contains tube-specific exceptions and error handling.
 * <p>
 * This package provides exception types specific to tube operations, initialization,
 * and lifecycle management. These exceptions represent error conditions that may occur
 * during tube creation, configuration, or execution. As part of the original Samstraumr
 * architecture, this package is being migrated to the new Clean Architecture.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and is gradually being replaced
 *             by org.s8r.component.exception in the new Clean Architecture. New code should
 *             use the component exception package instead.
