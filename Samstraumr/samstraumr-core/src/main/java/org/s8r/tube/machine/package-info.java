/**
 * Tube machine package provides orchestration capabilities for tube compositions.
 * <p>
 * This package contains the implementation of the Machine concept for tubes, which represents
 * a coordinated group of tubes that work together to perform complex operations. Machine
 * manages the lifecycle and data flow between tubes, providing higher-level abstractions for
 * system operations. This is part of the original Samstraumr architecture.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and is gradually being replaced
 *             by org.s8r.component.machine in the new Clean Architecture. New code should
 *             use the component machine package instead.
