/**
 * Tube test annotations package provides test categorization annotations for tube tests.
 * <p>
 * This package contains annotations used to categorize and organize tube-specific tests.
 * These annotations support the testing strategy for tubes by identifying which level of
 * the test pyramid each test belongs to, and what aspect of tube functionality they verify.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and is gradually being replaced
 *             by the org.s8r.test.annotation package in the new Clean Architecture. New code should
 *             use the standardized test annotations instead.
