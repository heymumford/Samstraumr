/**
 * Marks a test class or method as a Machine-level test.
 *
 * <p>Machine tests validate the behavior of interconnected composite tubes working together as a
 * state machine. These tests focus on:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>State transitions within the machine
 *   <li>Data flow between composites
 *   <li>Overall machine behavior according to its specification
 *   <li>Proper composite connection and interaction
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Machine tests are higher-level integration tests that ensure multiple components work together
 * correctly to achieve the intended functionality.
