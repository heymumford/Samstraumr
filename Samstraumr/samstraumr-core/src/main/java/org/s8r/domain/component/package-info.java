/**
 * Domain component package contains the core domain entities and business logic for components.
 * <p>
 * This package defines the component entities, their behaviors, and business rules that apply
 * to them within the domain layer of the Clean Architecture structure. The components in this
 * package are technology-agnostic and represent pure domain concepts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key concepts in this package:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Component - The core entity representing a processing unit</li>
 *   <li>Component identity - Unique identification and addressing</li>
 *   <li>Lifecycle states - State transitions and management</li>
 *   <li>Component relationships - Connections and hierarchy</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design and represents
 * the innermost circle of Clean Architecture, containing the core business logic
 * and entities of the system.
 * </p>
