/**
 * Domain component monitoring package provides functionality for monitoring component health and performance.
 * <p>
 * This package contains monitoring abstractions used within the domain layer to track component
 * health, collect metrics, and provide visibility into component behavior. These monitoring
 * capabilities are defined as part of the domain model, allowing for business-meaningful
 * monitoring that aligns with domain concepts rather than technical implementation details.
