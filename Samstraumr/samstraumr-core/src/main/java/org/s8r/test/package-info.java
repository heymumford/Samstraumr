/**
 * Test package provides testing infrastructure and utilities for the Samstraumr framework.
 * <p>
 * This package contains the testing framework components used throughout the Samstraumr
 * codebase, including test annotations, runners, and utilities. It supports the testing
 * pyramid implementation with clear separation between different test levels.
 * <p>
 * The test package is part of the main source code rather than test sources because
 * it provides reusable testing infrastructure that can be used by client code as well.
