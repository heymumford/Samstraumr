/**
 * Core tube functionality for the S8r framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the fundamental abstractions and implementations for the tube-based
 * processing model in the S8r framework. It is part of the package simplification initiative,
 * providing a more streamlined and intuitive organization under the simplified org.s8r root
 * package.
 *
 * <p>The tube concept in S8r represents self-contained processing units that can be composed into
 * more complex structures. Tubes are inspired by biological systems and follow a lifecycle pattern
 * that mimics development and growth.
 *
 * <p>Key concepts in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Status - Operational states of components
 *   <li>LifecycleState - Developmental stages of components based on biological models
 *   <li>Identity - Core identity mechanisms for tubes and components
 *   <li>Environment - Context definition for component execution
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When adding new classes to this package, follow these guidelines:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Focus on core abstractions rather than specific implementations
 *   <li>Use clear, concise naming that describes the concept
 *   <li>Include detailed JavaDoc explaining the purpose and usage
 *   <li>Maintain consistent terminology across related concepts
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package serves as the foundation for building complex component hierarchies and
 * processing flows in the S8r framework.
