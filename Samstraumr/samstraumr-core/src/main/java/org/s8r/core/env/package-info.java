/**
 * Environment-related functionality for the S8r framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains classes responsible for managing and providing information about the
 * runtime environment in which components operate. It is part of the package simplification
 * initiative, providing a more streamlined organization under the simplified org.s8r root package.
 *
 * <p>Environment information is critical for components that need to adapt their behavior based on
 * the system they're running on, such as resource allocation, feature availability, and diagnostic
 * information.
 *
 * <p>Key concepts in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Environment - Core class providing system information and unique identification
 *   <li>Parameters - Configuration values that can be provided to components
 *   <li>Environment ID - Unique identifier for a specific runtime environment
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The environment package facilitates environment-aware behavior in components, enabling them to
 * make intelligent decisions based on their runtime context.
