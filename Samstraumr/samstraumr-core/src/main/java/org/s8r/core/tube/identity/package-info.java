/**
 * Identity-related functionality for the S8r framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains classes responsible for managing component identity and lineage. It is
 * part of the package simplification initiative, providing a more streamlined organization under
 * the simplified org.s8r root package.
 *
 * <p>The identity concept in S8r is inspired by biological systems, where a component maintains a
 * continuous identity throughout its lifecycle, even as it undergoes changes in state and
 * structure. This approach provides a robust foundation for tracking component relationships,
 * lifecycles, and provenance.
 *
 * <p>Key concepts in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Identity - Core identity representation with unique identification and lineage
 *   <li>Hierarchical Addressing - Component location within the component ecosystem
 *   <li>Adam Components - Origin points in the identity hierarchy
 *   <li>Parent-Child Relationships - Lineage tracking through component relationships
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The identity package forms the foundation for component awareness, enabling components to
 * understand their place in the overall system and maintain continuity across state changes.
