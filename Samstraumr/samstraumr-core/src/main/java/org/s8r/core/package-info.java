/**
 * Core package contains fundamental framework abstractions and implementations.
 * <p>
 * This package provides the core abstractions that form the foundation of the Samstraumr framework.
 * It includes base classes and interfaces that define the fundamental concepts of the system,
 * such as environment configuration, exception handling, and tube implementation.
 * The core package is a legacy package that is gradually being migrated to the Clean Architecture design.
 *
 * @deprecated This package is part of the legacy architecture and will be gradually replaced
 *             by the domain, application, and infrastructure packages in the Clean Architecture.
 *             New code should use those packages instead.
