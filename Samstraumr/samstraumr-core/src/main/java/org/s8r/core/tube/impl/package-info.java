/**
 * Implementation classes for the S8r framework component model.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the concrete implementations of the component model abstractions defined
 * in the parent package. It is a complete replacement of the legacy implementations, providing a
 * cleaner, more maintainable approach to the component model.
 *
 * <p>The implementation focuses on:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Clean, simple code that is easy to understand and maintain
 *   <li>Full implementation of the conceptual model defined in the parent package
 *   <li>Proper separation of concerns and responsibilities
 *   <li>Efficient resource management and lifecycle handling
 *   <li>Integration with the environment, identity, and logging subsystems
 *   <li>Comprehensive lifecycle management with biological-inspired states
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Key implementations in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.core.tube.impl.Component} - Core implementation replacing the legacy Tube
 *       class
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create environment
 * Environment env = new Environment();
 *
 * // Create root component
 * Component root = Component.create("Root component", env);
 *
 * // Create child component
 * Component child = Component.createChild("Child component", env, root);
 *
 * // Access component identity and lineage
 * Identity identity = child.getIdentity();
 * System.out.println("Hierarchical address: " + identity.getHierarchicalAddress());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The core Component class is the primary implementation, providing the fundamental capabilities
 * needed by all components in the system. Specialized components for specific purposes can extend
 * this base implementation.
