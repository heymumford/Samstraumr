/**
 * Provides exception handling for the component model in the S8r framework.
 * 
 * <p>This package contains exceptions for handling error conditions in the component
 * model. It provides a centralized approach to error handling and reporting,
 * following a standard exception hierarchy:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.component.exception.ComponentException} - Base exception for component errors</li>
 *   <li>Specialized exceptions for specific error conditions</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This package is part of the simplified structure, replacing the scattered
 * exception classes in the legacy implementation with a unified approach.
