/**
 * Core implementation of the component model in the S8r framework.
 * 
 * <p>This package contains the fundamental component abstractions and implementations
 * for the S8r framework. It provides the essential infrastructure for components to maintain
 * their hierarchical design, identity, and operational capabilities.
 * 
 * <p>Key classes in this package:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.component.core.Component} - Base component implementation</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.s8r.component.core.State} - Unified state enum combining operational and lifecycle states</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This package is part of the simplified structure, replacing the org.s8r.core.tube.impl
 * package and flattening the hierarchy for better organization.
