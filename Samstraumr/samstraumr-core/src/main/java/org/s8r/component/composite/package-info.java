/**
 * Component composite package provides functionality for creating and managing composite components.
 * <p>
 * This package defines how components can be composed together to form more complex structures.
 * It includes the Composite pattern implementation for component hierarchies, allowing components
 * to be treated uniformly whether they are individual components or compositions of components.
 * The package provides factories and utility classes for creating and managing these composite structures.
