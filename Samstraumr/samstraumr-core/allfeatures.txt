Feature: Samstraumr Base Tube Adaptability and Self-Correction

  As a developer using the Samstraumr framework
  I want the base tube to adapt and self-correct using AI
  So that the system remains efficient, maintainable, and aligns with modern development practices

  Background:
    Given a Samstraumr base tube integrated with AI capabilities

  Scenario: Adaptive Processing Based on Input Data
    Given the base tube is processing a data stream
    And the characteristics of the input data change over time
    When the base tube analyzes the input data using AI algorithms
    Then it adjusts its processing logic to optimize performance
    And the system adapts without manual intervention

  Scenario: Self-Correction Upon Error Detection
    Given the base tube encounters an error during data processing
    When the base tube utilizes AI to diagnose the error
    Then it automatically applies a fix to resolve the issue
    And processing resumes seamlessly
    And the incident is logged for future reference

  Scenario: Modular Integration of New Tubes
    Given a new processing requirement emerges
    When a corresponding tube is developed and plugged into the system
    Then the base tube recognizes and integrates the new tube
    And data flows through the new tube without disrupting existing processes

  Scenario: Automated Code Review and Optimization
    When the base tube's code is updated
    Then AI-driven agents perform an automated code review
    And suggest optimizations and best practices
    And the recommendations are applied to improve code quality

  Scenario: Real-time Scaling Based on Demand
    Given fluctuating processing demands
    When the system experiences increased load
    Then the base tube scales up resources in real-time
    And scales down when the demand decreases
    And resource utilization is optimized

  Scenario: Enhanced Collaboration Through Standardized Communication
    Given multiple tubes developed by different teams
    When the tubes communicate using standardized protocols
    Then they interact seamlessly without compatibility issues
    And collaboration is enhanced across teams

  Scenario: Secure Handling of Sensitive Data
    Given the base tube processes sensitive information
    When data privacy and security protocols are applied
    Then the data is encrypted during processing
    And security measures adapt to new threats using AI insights

  Scenario: Logging and Monitoring for Continuous Improvement
    When the base tube processes data
    Then it logs performance metrics and processing details
    And AI analyzes logs to identify improvement areas
    And the system evolves based on analytical insights

Feature: Tube Initialization and System Detection
  # This feature file exercises the positive tests for initializing a single Tube, focusing on system and hardware detection.
  # It ensures that the Tube can gather relevant details about the operating environment and display them to stdout.
  # The tests are designed to be mutually exclusive (no overlap in what they test) and collectively exhaustive (cover all important aspects).

  # This scenario validates that the Tube, when instantiated, can capture and print the full set of system information.
  # The system information includes personalized details such as the hostname, machine name, and logged-in user.
  # It also captures hardware details like processors, threads, GPUs, and metal type (e.g., server, laptop).
  # The significance lies in ensuring the Tube’s ability to dynamically assess the environment it's running in,
  # allowing for better adaptability in distributed or resource-constrained systems.
  @ATL @P0 @Initialization @SystemDetection
  Scenario: Single Tube initializes with system and hardware information
    Given the operating environment is ready
    When a new "adam" Tube is instantiated with reason "System Detection Test"
    Then the Tube should print to stdout the following system information:
      | Host Name      | <hostname>         |
      | Machine Name   | <machinename>      |
      | Logged In User | <loggedinuser>     |
    And the Tube should print to stdout the following hardware information:
      | Processors    | <processorcount>   |
      | Usable Threads | <threadcount>      |
      | GPU           | <gputype>          |
      | GPU Count     | <gpucount>         |
      | Memory        | <memorysize>       |
      | Metal Type    | <metaltype>        |

  # This scenario focuses exclusively on personalized system details, which are vital for user-specific behaviors or access.
  # Capturing the hostname, machine name, and logged-in user ensures that the Tube can behave differently based on the
  # specific user or machine, aiding in tailored execution. This is critical for ensuring compatibility and traceability
  # in diverse environments.
  @ATL @P0 @Initialization @PersonalizedInfo
  Scenario: Tube captures personalized system information
    Given the operating environment is ready
    When a new "adam" Tube is instantiated with reason "Personalized Info Test"
    Then the Tube should print to stdout the host name as "<hostname>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the machine name as "<machinename>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the logged-in user as "<loggedinuser>"

  # This scenario tests the Tube’s ability to accurately detect and report hardware details such as the number of processors,
  # usable threads, GPUs, and memory. Knowing this hardware information is essential for optimizing performance and resource
  # allocation in resource-intensive operations, especially in environments with varied hardware configurations.
  @ATL @P0 @Initialization @HardwareDetection
  Scenario: Tube detects hardware details on initialization
    Given the operating environment is ready
    When a new "adam" Tube is instantiated with reason "Hardware Detection Test"
    Then the Tube should print to stdout the processor count as "<processorcount>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the usable thread count as "<threadcount>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the GPU type as "<gputype>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the GPU count as "<gpucount>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the memory size as "<memorysize>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the metal type as "<metaltype>"

  # This scenario is focused on the specific detection and printing of GPU and CPU information, which are key
  # components in high-performance and parallelized applications. Ensuring the Tube can reliably access and report
  # GPU and CPU information is crucial for performance diagnostics and system tuning.
  @ATL @P0 @Initialization @GPU @CPU
  Scenario: Tube prints GPU and CPU information
    Given the operating environment is ready
    When a new "adam" Tube is instantiated with reason "GPU and CPU Detection Test"
    Then the Tube should print to stdout the GPU type as "<gputype>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the GPU count as "<gpucount>"
    And the Tube should print to stdout the processor count as "<processorcount>"
