# Bundle to Composite Terminology Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to update outdated "bundle" terminology to the current "composite" terminology across the Samstraumr codebase.

## Background

As part of the ongoing refactoring effort documented in `docs/guides/migration/BundleToCompositeRefactoring.md`, the "Bundle" concept was renamed to "Composite" to better align with established design patterns. Most Java code had already been updated, but there were remaining references in test resources and documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feature File Updates

1. **Renamed Directory Structure**
   - `/tube/features/L1_Bundle/` → `/tube/features/L1_Composite/`
   - `/composites/features/L1_Bundle/` → `/composites/features/L1_Composite/`

2. **Renamed Feature Files**
   - `bundle-connection-test.feature` → `composite-connection-test.feature`

3. **Updated Feature File Content**
   - Updated references to "bundle" in feature file headers to "composite"
   - Updated all `@L1_Bundle` tags to `@L1_Composite`
   - Updated scenario descriptions with "composite" instead of "bundle"

### 2. Test Tag Ontology Updates

1. **Updated `TagOntology.md`**
   - Changed `@BundleTest` → `@CompositeTest`
   - Changed `@L1_Bundle` → `@L1_Composite`
   - Modified test type descriptions to refer to composites instead of bundles

### 3. Java File Updates

1. **Updated JavaDoc in `CompositeConnectionSteps.java`**
   - Updated the reference to feature file from `CompositeConnectionTest.feature` to `composite-connection-test.feature`

### 4. Build Configuration Updates

1. **Updated Maven Profile Descriptions**
   - Changed Maven profile description from "Component (Composite/Bundle) Tests Profile" to "Component (Composite) Tests Profile"

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Terminology**
   - The codebase now consistently uses "composite" instead of "bundle"
   - Removes confusion for new developers working with the code
   - Aligns with documentation and class naming

2. **Better Design Pattern Alignment**
   - The Composite pattern from Gang of Four design patterns is now consistently referenced

3. **Forward Compatibility**
   - Tests and documentation no longer refer to deprecated concepts

## Affected Components

1. **Feature Files**: 4 feature files updated
   - composite-connection-test.feature
   - observer-tube-test.feature
   - transformer-tube-test.feature
   - validator-tube-test.feature

2. **Java Files**: 1 file updated
   - CompositeConnectionSteps.java

3. **Build Files**: 1 file updated
   - pom.xml

4. **Documentation**: 1 file updated
   - TagOntology.md
