# API Documentation

This document provides an overview of the **Samstraumr Causality Engine** API and the relevant endpoints and methods.

## Introduction

The **Samstraumr Causality Engine** is designed to process time-series data and perform causality analysis. This document will be expanded as the API is implemented. The engineâ€™s API will expose endpoints for ingesting data, performing analyses, and retrieving results.

### Features of the API

- **Data Ingestion**: Submit time-series data for processing.
- **Causality Analysis**: Request Granger causality analysis between various datasets.
- **Result Retrieval**: Obtain processed analysis results including correlation and prediction models.
- **Modularity**: The API will allow for plug-and-play components enabling easy extension with new types of analysis and visualization.

## API Endpoints (Coming Soon)

### 1. Data Ingestion

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/ingest`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Ingest time-series data for processing.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "data": [
      {"timestamp": "2023-09-20T12:00:00Z", "value": 100},
      {"timestamp": "2023-09-20T12:01:00Z", "value": 101},
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

### 2. Causality Analysis

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/analyze`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Perform causality analysis on the ingested data.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "dataset1_id": "abc123",
    "dataset2_id": "xyz456",
    "method": "granger"
  }
  ```

### 3. Retrieve Results

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/results/{analysis_id}`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Retrieve the results of a causality analysis.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "analysis_id": "abc123",
    "result": "Dataset1 Granger-causes Dataset2 with p-value 0.01"
  }
  ```

## Authentication

API requests will require an API key for authentication. Details on API key generation and usage will be provided once the security layer is implemented.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair use and prevent abuse, rate limiting will be implemented. Each user will be allotted a number of requests per minute, which can be adjusted based on user tier or subscription plan.

## Future Enhancements

As the Samstraumr Causality Engine evolves, the following features will be integrated into the API:
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Continuous ingestion and analysis of time-series data streams.
- **Customizable Analysis Methods**: Users can provide their own causality or correlation methods.
- **Visualizations**: Retrieve graphical representations of data and analysis results.

Stay tuned for updates as we roll out these features!
