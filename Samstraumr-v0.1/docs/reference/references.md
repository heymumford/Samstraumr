## Dr. Bob

Dr. Bob is a renowned figure in the field of software engineering, known for his contributions to the development of agile methodologies and best practices in coding. His work emphasizes the importance of clean code, modular design, and continuous integration, all of which align with the principles of Tube-Based Design in the Samstraumr framework.

## Ray Dalio

Ray Dalio is a successful investor and author known for his principles on decision-making, life management, and business. His concept of "Thinking in Machines" has influenced the Samstraumr framework, particularly in the emphasis on viewing systems as interconnected, self-regulating entities. Dalio's work on understanding systems and making data-driven decisions is reflected in the modular, adaptable approach of Tube-Based Design.

## Object-Oriented Design Principles

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles are foundational in software development, focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These principles emphasize the importance of creating software that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. While Samstraumr introduces a different way of organizing code through Tubes, it builds on the solid foundation of OOD by promoting modularity and clear interfaces.

## Functional Programming Design Principles

Functional Programming (FP) design principles offer an alternative approach to software development, focusing on immutability, first-class functions, and pure functions. These principles lead to code that is often easier to reason about and test. Samstraumr complements FP by encouraging modular design and dynamic interactions, making it easier to integrate FP concepts within a broader system architecture.

## Thinking in Terms of Machines

"Thinking in Terms of Machines" is a concept popularized by Ray Dalio, which involves viewing complex systems as a series of interconnected machines that operate based on clear rules and inputs. This perspective has influenced the Tube-Based Design of Samstraumr, where each Tube can be seen as a machine with well-defined interactions and behaviors. By thinking in machines, developers can create systems that are easier to understand, modify, and scale.
